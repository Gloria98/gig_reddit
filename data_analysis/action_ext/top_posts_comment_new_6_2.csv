0,Etsy,In light of etsy’s new 15% mandatory advertising fee  what say we all take an Etsy shop vacation protest?,If you haven’t heard about etsys upcoming mandatory money grab policy where they use your Merch to advertise and then take a 15% sale of the cut if someone clicks the ad and buys your product. What say we all pick a day the put our shops on vacation until Etsy rolls back this ridiculous policy. We can easily make our voices heard if we stand together in vacation solidarity. #etsyvacation thoughts?
0,EtsySellers,"Etsy is making changes to ads - now MANDATORY for me to participate because I'm ""successful""", Take a look at the email I just got. I am furious:  A new risk-free way to advertise  You know advertising is key to growing your shop and expanding your reach. But  you’ve told us that promoting your products across the web feels risky because you could pay for ads that don’t lead to a sale.   Today  we’re excited to announce two updates to help you increase traffic to your shop with advertising.   First  we’re introducing an expanded advertising service: Offsite Ads. We’ll pay the upfront costs to advertise your listings on multiple high-traffic sites including Facebook  Instagram  Pinterest  and Bing in addition to Google.   We’re also making some changes to Etsy Ads to put you back in control of your advertising investment. Your Etsy Ads budget  which previously went to both onsite and Google Shopping ads  will now only go toward promoting your listings on Etsy.  Here’s how Offsite Ads works: We’ll pay to promote your listings across the web. When a shopper clicks on an online ad featuring one of your listings and purchases from your shop within 30 days  you’ll pay an advertising fee on that order. You only pay an advertising fee when you make a sale. Offsite Ads is only available on Etsy—we designed it with your unique needs in mind.   Your shop is a success story—you made more than $10 000 USD in sales in the past 12 months. That means you’ll benefit most from this advertising service  so you’ll be required to participate. You’ll also get a discounted rate of 12% for the lifetime of your shop  while most sellers will pay a 15% fee.     You’ll be able to see exactly how many sales you’re getting from Offsite Ads on your new dashboard  which will be available in a few weeks  and you’ll start being charged later in April.   You can get more details about this change in the Seller Handbook and we’ll keep you posted over the next few weeks.

Right now the orders pay crappy  the market is extremely over saturated and the support barely had the tools to help in situations when it’s directly their fault. How does one dash for 8.5 hours to make $22.... in other states since the cost of living is sooooo cheap they can tip nice and most places are quite the distance in small rural places. Not even the drive offers are worth it after all the hype $5 drive orders is ridiculous

We will keep it community run  non-profit  and free forever  and unlike some of its other hospex counterparts  it will not only have all the features you love  but also improvements on its predecessors. You can [read our full plan here](https://couchers.org/solutions).  We were amazed by the response to our [initial announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/gv707a/couchersorg_be_part_of_building_the_new_platform/)  receiving over 200 signups to help build the Couchers.org platform; others with years of couch-surfing experience that wanted to see something better. From that enthusiastic response  we were able to put together a dedicated team of software engineers  graphic designers  and community leaders.  Since work got underway  we have committed hundreds of hours of our spare time to create something built properly  which we’ll have ready just in time for when people are really traveling again.  With the alpha version of Couchers.org coming in the next few weeks  we are looking for more marketers  graphics &amp; UI/UX designs  backend/frontend engineers  and community organisers to [join our team](https://couchers.org/signup).

1,doordash_drivers,Doordash Strike For Coronavirus Hazard Pay,"I think that the title says it all. I am a Dasher in the Snohomish county area where the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected.  As many of us know  it's a bit nerve racking to say the least to be out and about doing everything we can to keep from being infected while visiting numerous restaurants and attempting to keep our distance to all we come in contact with.  If it wasn't for us delivery drivers  many of these restaurants we pick up for would be currently out of business  so we are a necessity for sure and Doordash relies on us to put ourselves in harm's way so that they can continue to make that almighty dollar.  The fact that we are all still working through this pandemic with absolutely zero hazard pay is ridiculous and an insult to be frank.  There is no doubt that many reading this petition will eventually succumb to the coronavirus. It's going to be a statistical fact. I see a lot of older individuals dashing now and some of them will not see the end of this crisis  yet we keep on keeping on.  I typically wouldn't take the time to post something like this  but this virus is the real deal. Even if you are younger and not worried about the virus  you should be worried about becoming asymptomatic and then spreading the virus to those around you that may not fair as well as yourself such as your parents or grandparents or even your friends parents or grandparents.  Since we are literally in the front line of fire when it comes to the coronavirus  I think that each and every Dasher that puts themselves and their families lives in harm's way should be compensated.  On top of our regular deliveries we should all receive an additional $5 for each and every delivery we make until our government has given us the ""All Clear"".  There is ABSOLUTELY no good reason that Doordash hasn't already launched a coronavirus hazard pay for all it's Dashers. The companies within the delivery industry should have all already done this on their own.....we shouldn't even have to ask  but be as it may  we need to make a show of force  otherwise  it's just business as usual for the Doordash corporate elites  all the while dashers are getting sick and or dying.  In order for a strike to work  we all have to rally together so I think it would be best to let this post marinate for a couple of weeks until we know that we have the numbers to pull off the strike.  Let's make the strike date for April 15th. That's will give us two weeks to share this post with each and every Dasher that we come across or already know.  I don't think that asking for an additional $5 for each delivery is too much to ask. Quite literally  our lives and our family members lives are all at risk with each and every delivery that we make.  Once we hit 1000 signatures for this petition I will reach out to a number of news outlets so that our cause gets a little publicity.  Please sign the petition   http://chng.it/ZRcTMpmM  so that we can show Doordash that we are all standing together on this one.  Stay safe and wash  wash  wash."

2,doordash,Karen has officially joined DoorDash,"Looks like the newly-laid-off soccer moms are starting to join DoorDash - in fact  I found Karen today at the Thai restaurant I was picking up from.  I was waiting patiently at this restaurant that I know well - I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait  which I was fine with because the pay was great and the owner of this particular establishment is actually honest when he says 10 minutes (I actually probably got my order in 7-8 minutes). I notice a white Chrysler Pacifica swerve into one of the very front spots  ignoring the fact that it was supposed to be a curbside pickup spot. Of course  I halfway expected Kathryn Hahn to emerge from the van like in the Chrysler commercials  but I got full-on Karen instead. Local baseball team cap  tied ponytail  midlife crisis mom  she slams the driver's door and speedwalks to the door with this look in her eyes like she's on a true mission.  She opens the door and before the door can even close  practically yells out  ""DoorDash!"" No name  nothing like that  just yells it out. She gets no response because everybody was busy in the kitchen. She goes to the little pickup table  which is of course empty  and mutters something under her breath (I'll take a wild guess and say it was probably vulgar).  ""Excuse me!!!!"" she bellows to nobody in particular  sounding just exasperated at not being paid attention to for 15 seconds. Eventually  the owner  who's the sweetest lady in the world  comes out and asks for the name on the order. Karen sighs  makes a big show of taking her phone out of her back pocket (why why why do so many women do this?)  and practically grunts with effort at having to unlock her phone and scroll down to read the name.  The owner of the restaurant says it will be about a 5 minute wait. FIVE MINUTES. Karen clearly doesn't find this acceptable  and just turns away from the owner without even a word. She finds me in her field of view standing with my DoorDash bag ready  and hones in  talking to me so that the owner can clearly hear.  ""Oh  you too! How is this acceptable? Are we paid to stand here?""  I don't even say anything because I don't know what to say. She continues   ""Is this *normal?* What's even the point of DoorDash?""  At this point  I just tell her to be patient  it's only 5 minutes. She exclaims  ""oh STOP "" and quits paying attention to me. After calling back into the kitchen with no response a couple more times  her food comes out. She just glares at the owner as she grabs the food and leaves. No eye contact with me either.  The cherry on top is that of course  Karen is one of those douchey people who remote starts their car when they are directly outside of it. She remote starts it  but the doors are locked  so she has to fumble for her keys again and unlock  probably cursing under her breath. She guns her Pacifica out of the parking lot.  Point of the story is that they are among us  folks. The Karens are infiltrating DoorDash. Is this the end?"
2,lyftdrivers,Attorney here. Decided to try lyft for fun... Now I kind of want to sue Lyft...,Holy shit  Lyft is exploitative as fuck to you guys. I have had fun with passengers but Jesus..   Last night  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'll do a ride. Drop off the first passenger at 12:30am. Lyft then added a ride without informing me  but it was just 3 minutes away so I thought  okay I'll do it. Pickup the passenger  then as I'm driving I look at how far the drop off was. Lyft never mentioned it was a long ride before pickup. 93 miles away in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I only had 30 miles to empty. Nearest gas station  40 miles.   Ran on 0 miles remaining for 7 miles. Passenger was great and super grateful anyone picked him up because he was stranded at an airport.   Total pay  $57  including $4 in tolls. Dropped him off at 2:30am and headed home  an almost two hour trip  plus I had to pay the toll again. Get home at 4:30am.   Screw emailing Lyft. I'm calling and going full attorney prick mode.   Anyway  sorry for you folks that get exploited by Lyft doing it for a living. The shit they pull is unbelievable.   Oh and just a tip  if you don't already know since Lyft doesn't track your miles to your next ride  those miles  even though unpaid  are tax deductible.
2,uberdrivers,Please piss off  people joining Uber,ALL these years  ALL these people saying for me to get a REAL job. All these people acting like they are better then us. Now they get laid off and all start jumping on Uber. Lol fuck them. Fuck their questions about onboarding. Fuck their questions about how to use the app... And seriously fuck them for over saturating the market and making it harder to ride share. Thank God most are noobs and incompetent at doing anything other then working as a corporate slave so they don't know how to effectively do the gig. No one fucking tell them either. Stop helping these people who shit on us and now are all jumping in the same boat because somehow we've become the life raft. Seriously pisses me off. Lol.

3,uberdrivers,"Why Wednesday's ""strike"" will be a big fat failure and a complete waste of time","Simply turning off the app will only increase surge rates and attract a bunch of new drivers which you'll have to compete with over the next few months in already oversaturated markets. Turning off the app will never work in your favor.  If you really wanted to disrupt Uber and Lyft  you would **accept rides then sit**  if several thousand people did this in a large metropolitan are such as Los Angeles  it would prevent new drivers and so-called ""scabs"" from getting rides and riders would have to wait extra long for rides.  Accept.  Sit.  Disrupt."
3,uberdrivers,When on strike  use Uber's network against them.,When on strike  remain online  text your passenger you are on strike and will not be taking them to their destination.  The passenger will likely bring this up to the next driver who picks them up out of frustration or interest. This will spread the word to drivers who are not aware in real-time through out the day. Use Uber's network against them.  Also  someone cross-post to lyft.

3,uberdrivers,We should be fighting to be treated like contractors not employees.,So many of you guys are fighting for the wrong cause. We shouldn’t be fighting to be treated more like employees we should be fighting to be treated more like contractors.      Having a blanket TOS for all contracts is actually against most contract law. Each individual contract is supposed to be treated as a separate agreement thus we should be given much more information about the ride before we accept the contract otherwise what we are doing is not contract work  it more closely resembles that of a commission based employee.   All I want is to be treated like a contractor which is what all of us should actually be fighting for.
3,lyftdrivers,Is anyone here participating in the strike on Wednesday morning?,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18531089/uber-lyft-driver-strike-ipo-protest-ride-hail  The focus is on Uber but it looks like both platforms are going to strike to send a message.  Seems like it's mostly isolated to a few big cities like Boston and Philly and Cali right now but I'm curious if anyone here is going to participate? I don't really drive on the morning shift so I'll be participating incidentally.  As much as I hope this has literally any effect at all I don't have much faith.

People out here risking everything for the same amount of peanuts.   Look through this reddit you find people saying Lyft doubling the fare right now and not paying drivers. I don't know if that's true but it wouldn't surprise me.  I'm not driving for the same amount of money. I'll sit on my ass and wait for the Trump check before I drive 1 more minute for these greedy bastards! Get a me a job stocking shelves somewhere if I have to.  I don't expect this post to go anywhere because 90% of that participate here are rental car and Lyft shills. Expect all downvotes. But maybe somebody will see it and do something.

4,AmazonFlexDrivers,I gave up and joined a DSP,It’s been really difficult to get the blocks I need from the warehouse that I want so I just gave up and joined a DSP from the warehouse that’s literally just 5 minutes away from my house.   I just think it’s a better decision because I was Flex-ing full time. I was trying to get 2 blocks a day  5 days a week and I was having to drive 40 minutes to the next closest warehouse. With the DSP  I won’t have to be competing to get blocks and pressing the refresh button a million times a day to get one block. With a DSP  I’ll be able to go to the warehouse that’s 5 minutes away from me everyday  I won’t have to take a 2 hour break in between blocks  I won’t have to wear out my car or pay for gas  and they actually pay more.   If you’re just doing Flex for some extra cash once in a while  then that’s perfect. But if you’re doing it full time  then definitely consider joining a DSP for all those benefits I said before.

4,doordash,Are Dashers on strike?,What's going on with Door Dash?? I've been using the company pretty much weekly for several months. Our orders are normally $80-$100. We haven't had any trouble until recently  almost every order for the past few weeks has been missing items(could be attributed to the restaurant)  but last night's experience has me never wanting to use Door Dash again.   We ordered $102 of food. At 8:55 I received a text that the driver was arriving. 4 minutes later I got another text saying the driver was having trouble locating me  and gave me a number to call the driver. I called 3 times and never got an answer. At 9:04 I received another text saying the driver left our order with a neighbor. We checked all the departments close to us and no one had received our food. I attempted to call customer service and the recording said to expect a 20-30 minute hold time  so I used the app to chat with customer service. When I signed in  I was #220 in line. When I finally spoke to someone  they attempted to call the driver and also got no answer. To further insult me  the rep tried to offer my $102 as a credit for food we didn't receive! I was told I would be getting my refund in 5-7 business days. I posted my experience on their Facebook page  and noticed there are quite a few complaints similar to mine  and Door Dash hasn't responded to any of them in the past 24 hours. With a 30 minute phone hold time  and 220 people in line to chat with customer service  and so many complaints on Facebook  it's almost like the company is giving up.   This is upsetting  because it's been such a good experience until recently.
4,doordash,Devils advocate,I have been dashing for a few months now and am new to this Reddit thread. I fail to understand why all the negativity and hostility toward doordash here.  I started dashing as a side gig to supplement my student loans in my free time. Doordash has allowed me to easily make another $200 a week with just a couple hours a day. I have tracked everyone of my dashes in a spreadsheet and average $15 an hour. Most of the time I just look for when my area is busy and dash for an hour or two. I love the flexibility  driving generally relaxes me and I only have to deal with people for a moment and 99% of those people are generally appreciate me.  I am content with the current pay system. I know upfront if the order is worth it to me. If I make anything more  well its a nice bonus.  The couple times I have had an order  i have found support to be very helpful and generally reply immediately.   I have had my share of slow restaurants but this is not DoorDash's fault. I either just wait patiently or decline the order. My main job has a fair amount of work I sometimes need to bring home so I usually just bring my tablet in and get it done while I wait.  My only complaint is of the stability of their servers. I get that things happen. Why not just relax for a few minutes  be patient and just dash when it comes back online?  This will probably be downvoted to oblivion with all the cynicism here but I am sure there are some who will agree Doordash isn't that bad.

I only started Amazon Flex this week  but as far as I know there is no way to see the package route until after you're done scanning the packages.

5,postmates,Fellow drivers whose accounts got hacked and money stolen  would you join me in a class action lawsuit?,I deliver for postmates in san diego  california. My account was hacked on july 16  and $110 was stolen from me  sent to a debit card that wasnt mine. Never clicked on fishy links  replied to spam emails  or gave out my info to someone calling me. I have reported it to support  but considering i got the typical reply of “change your password  update your banking info  the higher ups will deal with it” im guessing they wont do anything about it. I went through this subreddit and noticed that a LOT of people have had their accounts hacked and money stolen within the last  two-ish months. If postmates wont do something about this  WE WILL.  I know an attorney who specializes in class action lawsuits. He has successfully represented independent contractors who were harmed in the BP oil spill  hurricane katrina  along with many other cases. If you want to be a part of this  get your money back  and hold the hackers and postmates accountable please comment and/or message me to let me know. The case will likely only be taken if there are enough of us.

5,airbnb_hosts,Hosts file Class Action Suit against Air BnB,Air BnB changed their extenuating circumstance policy without providing the legal 30 day notice   their policy changed the word endemic to pandemic . Hosts were not given notice of this change   most hosts were working out solutions with their guests. We were in shock when Air BnB stepped in and refunded guests 100% of their booking stay at the expense of the host. I am grateful for all Air BnB has done to help us book our properties. As the years  passed   Air BnB got bigger  working with customer service has been challenging  but we made the best of it. Their latest move of refunding our guests has just about put us out of business. Nobody knew the pandemic was coming  these are hard times for everyone  but why is 100% of the burden put on the hosts? guests have the option of purchasing travel insurance  hosts do not. I found an attorney who is getting ready to begin a class action suit. There is no guarantee that we will win  but the attorney feels if 10 000 hosts join  they will most likely settle.
