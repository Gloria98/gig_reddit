0,InstacartShoppers,Why are you striking over TIPS  but not WAGES? (Only in capitalist-obsessed America),"Look  I get that people need to pay the bills and whatnot  but I think the tipping culture we have here in the US is insane. Its essentially more corporate welfare  and I feel like its permeating nearly every job in the gig economy and getting out of hand.   Instacart workers are now pushing for higher tips being required  as if tips should be a requirement in the first place! This is presumably in response to the fact that Instacart shoppers are not being paid enough by their EMPLOYER  and so somehow  they think that customers need to foot the bill instead. If you are not getting paid enough for a job  you should not be working that job--that should be a negotiation between you and your employer. Its the inflated tipping that is keeping these jobs afloat and luring people into thinking ""Oh  yeah  I will accept a $5/hour job because I might get lucky and snag those 25% (or $50) tippers!"" with jobs/businesses that in a normal market equilibrium would never take off paying people that low! IMO  instacart shoppers and other workers based on tips are shooting themselves in the foot and slowly doing away with their own jobs by making such demands  because the customers can and will eventually go elsewhere. From our position  a price is being advertised for a good or service  and then fees and ""tips"" are being tacked on at the end  on top of the fact that there is this underlying feeling that the higher I pay  the better service I'll get it  which is inherently unfair when a price has already been agreed upon.   And now there's an article floating around saying that Instacart shoppers can choose which jobs they want based on the amount of tips (and their address  which opens to a whole nother level of possible discrimination)? No wonder people are baiting them with $50 tips--its just as unethical to have been choosing who to service first based on what they can afford to pay in the first place!   Also  people do not take kindly to paying for other people wages when there employer won't pay enough. Listen  individual customers are low-wage struggling workers too  and you are gonna make the argument that they should be the ones paying more during a crises rather than the employer that you work for that makes millions of dollars in profits by paying you peanuts while you fight with customers over $10 here and there (most of whom are laid off  low wage workers themselves  and can barely afford it)?   I think most people would be totally fine paying a flat rate (or percentage based) fee that was across the board  so long as it was factored into the total price. No game playing  no bartering  just money for service/good. But tipping has allowed discrimination to enter in  with shoppers literally ignoring tips they deem to low or not going to places they think might be ""the hood"" or in a poor area.    Consumers would rather either cut out the middle man and pay the delivery person directly  or directly pay the middle man a service fee who negotiates with the delivery person how much of the total fee they should get as a wage. This triangular trade relationship being kept afloat by tips is only screwing the customers and the workers  while the pockets of the business/employer get fatter. Why aren't Instacart shoppers striking about that??"

0,EtsySellers,ETSY has become an EVIL Empire - JOIN ME and let's demand a meeting in person! STRIKE!,"I have posted about this before.   I am on the brink of crying  tearing my hair out  and almost ready to take 100's (or 1000's preferably) of ETSY sellers with me to the headquarters to demand a sit down meeting in person.   **WHO WILL GO WITH ME?** If any one is serious about this  I think we should organize hundreds of sellers and show up in person to demand a meeting with the CEO or Vice President at the very least. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **As if ETSY Ads wasn't getting bad enough - it just got worse as of** ***March 1st.***   If you have your listings enrolled in Etsy Ads - you may remember the good ol' days when you could customize your price per click according to YOUR understanding of your own niche market and products.   Now? ETSY determines what product bids at what price  regardless of asking for your permission.   I adjusted to this new system in recent months. In fact  ETSY ads brought me in additional $830 in extra revenue in the Month of February alone. ***Now I""m being punished for it.***   **A) Have you poured your sweat and will power into a new product  and listed it  excited to promoted it? ALL new listings are now biding at 0.35-0.55 a click. ALMOST HALF A DOLLAR OR MORE A CLICK? Reason? They told me (upon calling)  that they have to ""test"" to see where the product belongs amonsgst the promoted listings...** ***Really? Really?***  **B) Have you had some listings perform well from being promote through ETSY ads? I have. The more your listing succeeds while promoted in ETSY Ads  the more they will rise the price on you - thus making it impossible to continue advertising it.**   **I have had to OPT OUT 5 of my listings today because they were ""Successful"" last month being promoted. As of today  my best promoted listings that were AUTO bidding at an average of about .09-.11 a click  have now** ***TRIPLED.*** **FIVE of my most successful listings through ETSY ads have shot straight up to .30-.50 a click** ***OVER NIGHT!***   **Why? Because the system deemed those Ads ""profitable""  so apparently eating up my entire budget on a few clicks for the day is some how going to help bring ETSY more money? Wrong. You see  Etsy would have made more money giving me more visibility through allowing less price per clicks  and thus collecting the  5% transaction fees on MORE sales; rather than fleecing me .55/click simply because the listing proved itself to be profitable through the ETSY ads system last February.**    Let me tell you  we all know that 90% of shoppers are window shoppers. NO one can afford a $4-$5.00 daily budget just to get a tiny little handful of clicks. ETSY sellers use to get 100's of clicks a week when we could customize our own bids. **Now  TWO CLICKS will cost you $1.00 if your listing was determined to be profitable or if its a new listing.**. ***Add that up  and a seller may pay $200-$500 a month in advertising just to have a tiny little wee handful of clicks.*** We sellers NEED the promoted listings to gain exposure while we're just starting out. They are worth it to people looking to promote their shop. They have been worth it to me. I wouldn't have had $800 in extra revenue last month had it not been for ETSY ads. But now that I have 4-5 listings that proved successful in the system from last month  they are jacking up the price 3-4X. *All that means is that my shop's viability goes DOWN  and clicks are sliced in half or more because I cannot keep raising my daily budget to compensate with Auto bids of .35-55 a click!!!*  **THE MADNESS NEEDS TO STOP!**  Who else is sick and tired of having their daily budget eaten up within a few clicks by morning??   MARCH 1st means HUGE CHANGES in ETSY Ads behind our backs. Intended to rob you of every penny you're worth.   **WHO WANTS TO GO TO THE HEADQUARTERS WITH ME TO DEMAND A MEETING with the CEO or Vice president  or whoever will listen to us??**   If anyone else is fed up with the fleecing of ETSY sellers and stealing our advertising money  please tell me. **I will set up an Event to make it happen today.**   &amp;#x200B;  Signed   A very upset ETSY Seller"
0,doordash,Those that oppose the upcoming new pay structure  help me understand. A breakdown of my trips on DD and UE.,Before I ask  I’m here to understand your viewpoint. Not to argue. I really don’t comprehend how anyone can be against it. Here’s how I look at it.   Many of you say that DD pays you the guarantee even if there is no tip. Well of course! They are supposed to.   Let’s look at UE and PM for example  they pay you for the pick up  time  mileage  and drop off. The pick up and drop off alone are over the 1$ DD pays at minimum.   DD guarantees are based on estimated time and mileage. This is essentially what UE and PM does  except they pay you for it completely. Then add on the tip. What DD does is  they estimate all of this beforehand (which is the guarantee)  the take your tip and add it to the payout to minimize what they pay.   Yesterday I posted about a Wendy’s order where I got paid 8$ without tip. That order took 40 minutes. Some commented how we are lucky that DD still paid that amount. However  for a 40 minute order  UE would’ve paid that amount before tip.  Here an example of similar trips I made:  1.  DD - for the 40 minute order  got paid 8$ with no tip.  UE - for a 35 minutes order  I got paid 10$ BEFORE tips.   I ended up being paid 15$ for the UE order because of a 5$ tip. If I had been tipped those same 5$ in DD  i still would’ve be gotten 8$ (1$ DD  5 tip  and 2 DD)  How is DD beneficial in that scenario?  2.   DD - for a 15 minute order  the paid me 6$. 1$ DD  3$ tip  and 2$ DD.   UE- for a similar 15 minute order  UE paid me 4.5$ before tip. Sure it’s less than DD right? But then I got tipped 5$ making the total 10$. If this was DD  I would’ve gotten 6$ (1DD and 5 tip).   —  The only rare benefit is in DD short non tip orders. Where they still pay a good amount for a short trip. The lowest I seen DD offer is 5.50$  which is great! For a similar short non tip order  UE would pay about 3.50$. The thing is  I see 90% of customers tip in DD  so in realty this is rare. UE is also getting more and more tippers that end up making the payouts the same.  —  Please let me know your thoughts. I just can’t comprehend how some see the current system as beneficial.
0,doordash,HEAR ME OUT. Why we shouldn't be fighting DoorDash on how it uses the customer's tip to subsidize our wage.,"Think about it. People on Instacart are making the same amount of money now as they did before their recent pay change (took place on Feb. 19). Sure  tips don't subsidize wages. Now mileage is a part of it instead. They also added the fuckery of defaulting the tip the customer gives you to 0. If the customer blindly orders without paying attention  he/she may not even notice. Unless your customer likes tipping in cash or specifically asks if there is a tip  I think a lot more IC contractors will be getting $0 tip at all now.  So here we are with DoorDash. Yes  wages are subsidized by tips  but we still get paid well. Think about it. All we do is drive to the restaurant  pick up the food  and deliver it. Instacart workers are getting **nearly the same amount of pay as we do** and they have to drive to the store  shop for the order  go through checkout  load it up in the car  drive to the customer's house  unload it. It takes much longer  is much more effort  and pays the same as us. So yes  I think we are doing well for what we make per delivery with DoorDash.  But why am I saying this? All DoorDash has to do is recalculate how they will pay us. Everyone here thinks they're going to just pay the exact same except not use the customer's tip to subsidize the wage. That's what we all thought Instacart would do and we were **wrong**. As mentioned above  they recalculated how the wages are decided and now we make the exact same amount of money (possibly a tad less with the default tip being ""0"" now) as before the change.  What can DoorDash do if they stop subsidizing our wages with tips? * Lower the minimum guarantee and have a daily promo period where you do 80% of your offered deliveries during busy hours. Think of it like Postmates. EVERY night in my area they have an $8 promo period. However  with that $8 promo I make literally the same amount of money per order with Postmates that I do with DoorDash. They could do the same thing but make qualifications for the promo pay difficult. How would you like to be paid $4-$6 per delivery unless you accepted 80% of your batches? * Pay less per mile that we drive to the restaurant and customer's house. * Not pay mileage driving to the restaurant at all. * Change how much it costs to use the service  causing some customers to quit using the service and lowering business for drivers.  That probably isn't everything  but I hope you understand my point. If we fight this ""tips subsidize the wage"" payout  DoorDash will simply pull an Instacart and find a way to not pay us more money or worse pay us less (a la Postmates)."
0,EtsySellers,"Etsy is making changes to ads - now MANDATORY for me to participate because I'm ""successful""", Take a look at the email I just got. I am furious:  A new risk-free way to advertise  You know advertising is key to growing your shop and expanding your reach. But  you’ve told us that promoting your products across the web feels risky because you could pay for ads that don’t lead to a sale.   Today  we’re excited to announce two updates to help you increase traffic to your shop with advertising.   First  we’re introducing an expanded advertising service: Offsite Ads. We’ll pay the upfront costs to advertise your listings on multiple high-traffic sites including Facebook  Instagram  Pinterest  and Bing in addition to Google.   We’re also making some changes to Etsy Ads to put you back in control of your advertising investment. Your Etsy Ads budget  which previously went to both onsite and Google Shopping ads  will now only go toward promoting your listings on Etsy.  Here’s how Offsite Ads works: We’ll pay to promote your listings across the web. When a shopper clicks on an online ad featuring one of your listings and purchases from your shop within 30 days  you’ll pay an advertising fee on that order. You only pay an advertising fee when you make a sale. Offsite Ads is only available on Etsy—we designed it with your unique needs in mind.   Your shop is a success story—you made more than $10 000 USD in sales in the past 12 months. That means you’ll benefit most from this advertising service  so you’ll be required to participate. You’ll also get a discounted rate of 12% for the lifetime of your shop  while most sellers will pay a 15% fee.     You’ll be able to see exactly how many sales you’re getting from Offsite Ads on your new dashboard  which will be available in a few weeks  and you’ll start being charged later in April.   You can get more details about this change in the Seller Handbook and we’ll keep you posted over the next few weeks.
0,Etsy,Best way to deal with complainers? Especially people who seem to be picking a fight?,"Lately I have not been enjoying my Etsy gig as much as I used to  because of having to deal with complainers. As my shop grows  I'm finding that I deal with complainers more often than I used to.  &amp;#x200B;  I've started to dread going on Etsy now because everyday I wake up to 2-3 new orders (yay!)  but that pleasant news is often offset by 2-3 complainers (boo!). Where is my order? It says it will take up to 10 days to ship but can you ship it any faster? I need this sooner. I ordered the size S but I didn't realize it was small. I'm trying to track my order but there are no updates after the first few scans. Why is the tracking not updating anymore? etc  &amp;#x200B;  What is the best way to deal with customers like this? I do have a FAQ  but I've used up all the fields and it is not exhaustive. I used to respond to ALL messages right away  but I found that this wasn't the most productive way of using my time  so I started responding once a day to messages. I carve out one time a day where I sit down and respond to messages. However  I've found that for some customers  if they don't get a message right away  they get really upset.  These are the ones that are really demanding and rude about it  and the ones that really make me dread going on Etsy now. Any suggestions or tips on best practices to deal with customers like this?  &amp;#x200B;  I'm dealing with someone right now that is sucking all of the energy out of me  and it is surprisingly another Etsy shop. It looks like they started their shop around the same time I did  but they only have about 10 sales and a few reviews. About a month ago  they had a minor issue with their purchase  and they went straight to leaving a really snarky 3 star review. Although I was offended  I contacted them right away  apologized and offered to make it right. I addressed their issue  and sent them a complimentary gift as well for the ""inconvenience."" They responded thanking me for the good customer service  let me know that they received the replacement and that it is perfect  and also changed their review to 5 stars.  &amp;#x200B;  Fast forward 3 days later. They broke their product and lost one of the parts within one day. They complained about having to ship it back the second time  so I offered to pay for the shipping. Since they mentioned they lost one of their parts and don't know where it is  I pointed out that my policy does not cover lost parts  but I would be happy to replace it for free as a one time courtesy since they are another Etsy shop owner. I actually copied the main concepts/terms of the repair policy from another Etsy shop  but I didn't think anyone would actually lose a part so this is the first time I'm dealing with it.    &amp;#x200B;  In response to my message  which I thought was reasonable  this person BLEW UP on me and said my offer was unacceptable. Honestly  it seems like their entire message is trying to pick a fight. They even told me I was being rude by offering to replace their lost part as a courtesy. I am not really in the mood to apologize to someone when I feel like I've gone above and beyond  so I have just stopped responding to this person until I can figure out how to respond to them.  &amp;#x200B;  That said  I don't know what I'm supposed to do next. I'm tempted to refund/cancel so they can't do any more damage. During the time their review was 3 stars with a snarky review  I lost sales on that listing. I have a feeling that I can't make this person happy and they will leave an even snarkier  lower review regardless of what I do for them. Some people are just unhappy to the core  and I don't want to risk losing more sales because of something I cannot fix.  Another reason refunding seems like a good idea is for my mental health. I have a lot going on in my life right now  and I just don't have the energy or time to deal with the type of negativity brought by this person. I literally feel like my brain just shut down when they blew up on me in their last message.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand  I am a one-person shop and this is a $100+ order for a customized product I cannot resell. Plus  I have a lot going on in my life (see above) so refunding this order would be a huge hit.  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR:** I delivered a replacement to a complaining customer (that happens to be another Etsy shop)  which they claimed was ""perfect"" until they broke it. I believe that I went above and beyond by offering to pay for the shipping  and replace their lost part for free  but the customer blew up on me. What am I supposed to do next."
0,Etsy,I came across a “vintage” item that I knew was not actually vintage. I tried to take action and it backfired. What should I do if this happens again?,I have a bit of a collection of dirndls (traditional German dresses). About a year ago  I was looking to add to my collection by buying a vintage one on Etsy. And as I was browsing  I came across something odd: a listing for a dirndl I already own. Same pattern  same fabric  same brand. Exactly the same. It was listed as vintage  but I bought that dress at a German department store in 2014. It’s definitely not a vintage garment. Furthermore  even if the seller had bought it at a thrift shop and had no way of knowing it was mass-produced five years ago for a department store  it’d be obvious to anyone who knows anything about dirndls that this one is not vintage. There are a lot of rather obvious differences between a vintage and a modern dirndl. This one was unmistakably modern.  I decided to contact the seller. Maybe she didn’t know the dress was modern. I sent her a message saying “Just to let you know  I bought this exact same dress at a department store in 2014. I really have a hard time believing the dress you’re selling is vintage. You might want to look into it.” She took this as a compliment  and thanked me for letting her know that her “vintage” dirndl looked to be in such good condition. I wasn’t really sure how to respond at that point  so I didn’t.   Obviously  that was a long time ago  and the garment has since sold. But I’d like to know what to do if I ever come across something like that again. I think it’s rather fraudulent to try to pass off a 5-year-old dress as vintage  and I’d like to be able to shop for vintage items without having to worry about getting scammed. I looked on Etsy’s website to try to figure out how to report a violation of the Terms of Service  but all I could find was a written list of the rules  nothing on how to report a violation or when to report a violation. Also  I’m not even sure if reporting is the best course of action.   Have any of you ever had a situation like this? What did you do? What would you advise other Etsy shoppers to do in this situation?  Edit to add: i checked back at this seller’s shop. the seller is currently selling similar garments. I can tell from the tags and the fabric that they are less than ten years old  and I think I could find evidence for this on these brands’ websites. Should I do anything about this?
0,doordash,All of these changes since the NPM was released have been to defend people that don't tip or tip very poorly and that is the most frustrating part of it all,"Because of cheap customers complaining about their orders taking a long time to show up  we have ""actual amount may be higher"" to close the gap between high value and low value offers. So you now have to gamble on getting a huge payout or only getting an extra 50 cents.   Because of cheap customers we have ""suggested tipping"" that doesn't even break 15% on many orders so that even some of the most generous customers tip less and further shrink the pay gap from a cheap customer and a generous one.     Because of cheap customers we have preferred dashers! Where if you are enough of a chump to accept pretty much all of these orders you will have special privileges that make dashing more inefficient for almost everyone.     Because of cheap customers now everyone makes less money with seemingly no end in sight.     This gig app has seriously gone down the shitter and it just makes me despise cheapass customers even more than I ever have. They are the catalysts for all of this crap we have been dealing with. The only reason I ever turn on my dasher app is to fish for a monster order and or an expensive total wine order. This company is dead to me outside of that."
0,InstacartShoppers,Results of last 2 strikes have both been good for Instacart and bad for shoppers,Before you strike you should be paying attention to what the last 2 strikes have done for instacart.. Before strike one payscale was .40 per item plus a 3 dollar delivery fee   long distance mileage boost of 5.00 and 5.00 bumps for club store.. people were complaining about all the small batches paying too little   &amp;#x200B;   Results Instacart introduces the 10 dollar minimum batch pay and removes delivery fee  club bumps and boosted mileage  and no longer pays by item .. plus start using tips to make the 10 dollar minimum on lower batches and also start taking tips from bigger batches just because they can . this increases instacarts pay significantly and lowers the overall pay for shoppers by quite a bit except for the really small orders   &amp;#x200B;  Next strike results . Instacart stops stealing tips and reimburses shoppers for stolen tips.. but then lower the base pay to 7 dollars for full service shopping and 5.00 for delivery only . once again instacart starts making way more money on every batch shoppers start making even less   So the results show that they always end up finding a way to pacify the people while putting more money in their pocket. so strike away  the results will probably introduce another way for them to make more money for themselves and cut your pay in some other way

HG.org Legal Resources  Articles by Law     Articles by Lawyers     Submit an Article  Find a Law Firm:  Need a Lawyer? Let Us Help You  ➤  How to Calculate Damages in a Slander Case   ￼  Slander occurs when a person makes an unprivileged false statement of fact that causes harm to that person or his or her reputation. Determining the amount of damages in a given slander case can help the plaintiff and lawyer determine the potential value of the case and if it is worth pursuing.   Types of Damages  There are a number of different damages that a victim of slander may suffer. These include:  Actual or Special Damages  Actual or special damages are compensatory damages. These damages are intended to return the plaintiff to the position that he or she was at before the slander occurred so that he or is she is basically in the same situation as he or she would have been not having been wronged.  Actual damages can be calculated   FIND MORE LEGAL ARTICLES  SEARCH  to a certain dollar amount. They include all those damages that the plaintiff directly suffered due to the slander. This may include lost wages  lost earning capacity or loss of business opportunities. These may include the actual amounts lost or the amounts that are likely to be lost because of the slander.  To calculate lost earnings  the plaintiff can add up the wages that he or she lost from being out of work because of the slanderous statement. This also includes any employment benefits that were lost  such as using sick days or paid time off to deal with the slanderous statement.  Lost earning capacity is more difficult to prove and generally requires expert testimony. An expert may have to testify about how the plaintiff’s diminished earning capacity will affect his or her lifetime earnings. For example  if a person was working a $100 000 job and the slander caused him or her to be fired and to be ostracized from the position and was only able to earn $50 000  the annual amount of damages would start at $50 000. Reasonable pay increases based on the individual’s employment record would also be taken into consideration  as well as his or her prospects for promotion. Inflation may also be taken into consideration.    An expert may have to evaluate a variety of evidence in order to determine the difference between the plaintiff’s projected earnings before the slander in order to compare these with the projected earnings after the slander. The economic expert may examine the plaintiff’s tax returns  the current and projected economic state and the industry in which the plaintiff is employed and was employed.  If the plaintiff was a business owner  his or her losses may include the loss of existing clients and the lost business opportunities. Former clients may be called to testify that they stopped doing business because of the slander. An economic expert may be necessary to testify about the economic impact of such lost business opportunities and business goodwill. Actual damages also include the out-of-pocket expenses that the plaintiff has to pay because of the slander  such as the amounts he or she paid to a psychiatrist.  General or Non-Economic Damages  Another category of damages that may require calculation is general or non-economic damages. These damages are meant to compensate the victim for his or her damaged reputation  mental anguish and pain and suffering. This area of damages can be used to compensate victims for public humiliation  shame and disgrace.  Non-economic damages are assessed by the judge or jury that is hearing the case. If the case settles  the value of non-economic damages may be negotiated between the parties and their respective lawyers. Juries may be instructed to use their own reason  belief and experience to determine an appropriate amount of damages.  Some jurisdictions do not award victims of slander with non-economic damages. Some provide these damages to victims only if certain criteria are met  such as if the plaintiff was wrongfully accused of committing a crime or was significantly affected by the slander. Some states limit non-economic damages to victims of libel  written defamation  and not to oral defamation.  Punitive Damages  In some cases and jurisdictions  punitive damages may be assessed against the defendant. These damages are established to punish the defendant for egregious conduct and to deter similar conduct in future dealings. To receive punitive damages  the plaintiff may be required to meet a heavier burden of proof.  Mitigating Damages  Plaintiffs are generally required to mitigate their damages  meaning that they should take reasonable steps to minimize the damages that they suffer. For example  if the plaintiff is offered a similar job after losing another one due to the slanderous statement  he or she should generally take it. Otherwise  the defendant can argue that the amount of damages should be reduced by the salary that the plaintiff would have had if he or she took the position. Provided by hg.org  ￼
1,postmates,DOORDASH CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT........STEALING TIPS..WHOS NEXT?????????,   ## DOORDASH CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT  **ATLANTA  GA:** (February 8  2019) – Attorneys from Heninger Garrison Davis  LLC’s class action group filed a class action complaint today against DoorDash  Inc. (Defendant) for breach of contract and unlawfully taking tips that were intended for their delivery drivers.  DoorDash is a national food delivery service  and the case arises from their improper conversion of tips directed and intended for drivers.  DoorDash is an on-demand food delivery service which delivers meals from national 📷restaurant chains and local restaurants  as well as groceries from places like Wal-Mart.  When a customer places an order with DoorDash  a customer has the ability to leave an additional gratuity  or tip  for the DoorDash delivery drivers (called “Dashers”). The default “Dasher Tip” is currently set to 10% of the order  but the customer may also leave a custom tip.  In terms of compensation to its drivers  DoorDash promises each driver a guaranteed base pay for each delivery job  plus 100% of the gratuity.  However  DoorDash does not remit the full amount of gratuity that a consumer leaves for a Dasher.  Instead of paying this tip to the Dasher  DoorDash actually uses the gratuity to cover its costs for the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers.   For example  if DoorDash promised the Dasher $5 base pay for the delivery  and the customer tips the Dasher in an amount of $2  the Dasher still only gets $5.  On its website and other marketing materials  DoorDash deceptively advertises and represents that a gratuity can be added for a delivery and that the driver would receive “100% of tips” from the customer. DoorDash does not disclose that it keeps a substantial portion of this additional charge for itself as its own additional revenue to offset the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers. This deceptive compensation scheme is illegal and violates federal and state law.  HGD attorneys Jim McDonough and Lew Garrison bring the action on behalf of the Dasher plaintiffs against DoorDash  Inc. for breach of contract  negligent misrepresentation  fraudulent inducement  conversion  unjust enrichment  and violations of consumer protection laws.  The lawsuit seeks the return of tips rightfully earned by Dashers in order to remedy DoorDash’s improper withholding of those tips  which resulted in Dashers not receiving 100% of the tips that were intended for them.

1,couchsurfing,Suggestions for reforms I'd need to see before I'd contribute,"I sent the following email to support@couchsurfing.com . I feel fairly strongly that their leadership need to hear this; if you agree  does anyone have any suggestion of the best way to get it to them?  ----  Hi   As are many  I’m of two minds given the past two blog posts.  All the communications read like someone *trying to write what people want to hear.* No matter how talented a writer you are  authenticity somehow can’t be faked.   ""The COVID-19 global pandemic is severely impacting *your beloved Couchsurfing community*."" Whoever’s writing these posts might be 100% as well-intentioned as they claim  but I simply can’t believe that Couchsurfing is their community – it’s their job.  Couchsurfing is a table with three legs: without any one of them  it can’t stand. Money  technology  community. You need them all.  ----  You – or your predecessors – have lost the trust of your user base. This isn’t a problem that can be solved by writing better blog posts. ""Going forward  we will work on a process together with the Couchsurfing Ambassadors on *how we should communicate changes*.” Nah... that’s not going to cut it.  This is an “actions speak louder than words” moment: you can only win back trust with *meaningful structural changes*. The company and its community are estranged entities. You need to unite  or perish.  Community Ambassadors should be more than communications advisors: they should be members of the decision-making board.  ----  You said: “We have made a conscious effort to keep the focus on the Couchsurfing community.” What if  instead  you could say “the Couchsurfing community has been an integral part of our decision-making process”?  You said that “the community had remained the priority instead of making money.” What if you could instead say: “Together  our community leaders  operations and finance team  and engineers have been hard at work threading the needle  striking the (sometimes difficult) balance between competing needs  in order to keep us both a viable organization and a valuable community”?  You said: “We hear you.” But who even are you? What if  instead of signing off as a nameless  faceless “Sincerely  The Couchsurfing Team ” you were represented by actual couchsurfers?  ----  What if you could send out an email written in the first person  signed with a name and a face and a profile – an ambassador with a reputation in the community  glowing reviews on their profile  and a meaningful position in the company?  That’s what I need to see in order to financially contribute: not more transparency into the company as it is  but **a reform of the organization** which brings back the third leg of the table.  Unless I see that  I won’t give my money to a lost cause.  That being said  I hope to send you financial support soon!   Sending my very best wishes to all of you and your loved ones   Steven"
1,doordash,Can you sue a customer for libel or slander if they lie to doordash saying you didn't deliver?,Don't you think you could have a good case if you have photo evidence that you delivered the order?   Defamation (Libel &amp; Slander) Merrick Law Firm LLC represents employees and independent contractors in defamation actions. Under the common law of virtually all states  an individual has a legal cause of action against someone who makes false statements that cause damage to that individual's reputation.
1,EtsySellers,Anyone else have to fight a bogus patent infringement claim? Etsy won't help.,This guy in Russia filed bogus patent infringement complaints  not copyright. He already did that months ago  the copyright he cited was for a really old manuscript in Russia  not for a jewelry item.      What I can't sort out and Etsy won't help with is how do I counter this. There seems to be no process with Etsy to counter or dispute a patent violation claim. With the copyright claims you can relist after 10 days if you are sure they won't sue or you settle the issue with the claimant. This guy has no patent. He used the same bogus manuscript number as his patent claim and these jewelry items have nothing he could patent.      What do you do with a patent violation claim? There seems to be no process outlined.

1,postmates,Join me in this lawsuit,"- I have a team of lawyers - I have news/media connections - In contact with law enforcement agencies (department of justice and SEC Enforcement along with others)  1.) ""Updated itineraries"" is a breach of contract. Postmates is required to offer you each job and not pile them on you without your permission. ""Independent contractors"" pick and choose which jobs they want to accept  not Postmates regardless if you find it beneficial or not  its a breach of contract!  2.) Theres nothing in our contracts that states we will not be paid for miles driven to pickup location. Our contract states we will be paid for the pickup and we are to be paid for mileage but nothing in there states we should NOT be paid for the miles driven to the pickup location. We are owed for all miles driven to the pickup location.  3.) Orders that are canceled AFTER you accept them are supposed to result in a payout but they dont because again Postmates is breaching contracts. You are not employees that get paid hourly regardless of volume  you are independent contractors! When a driver accepts an order that is an AGREEMENT! if Postmates cancels the order after you accept it  they are responsible for payout or open themselves up for a lawsuit.  4.) Merchant refusing orders because they dont want Postmates business? Card declined? Merchant closed? You are owed a payout for these instances!   Come join me and stand up for yourselves before you end up homeless living out of your car or on the street!!!"

2,uberdrivers,MMA Fight Night right in my car,I’m all set to pick up “Pete” from a sports bar. Two older blokes approach the vehicle (doors locked). Are you Pete  I ask. Yes. I unlock the the doors and dudes start to get in the passenger side.   On the driver side  another dude gets in the car and says that HE is Pete  and tells other dudes to gtfo of his Uber. The other dude doesn’t stop getting in the back  so the real Pete decides to lay hands on the imposter Pete  who swings back.   Now real Pete is really pissed and leaps out of the car and tries to take on both older Petes and bedlam ensues. Meanwhile  both of my passenger side doors are open now. I run around  close both doors  and jump in and cancel the ride (Rider behavior) and haul ass out of there. Got a $3.75 cancel fee for it.   Get to the next traffic light  decide to look in the back seat  and lo and behold  real Pete has left his phone. I figured the fight had to have ended by then  so I turn around and head back. Real Pete is now standing in the parking lot not far from the imposter Petes  with no shirt on he was wearing an Astros jersey in Philly for some reason).   When I pull up  he says “you don’t have to take me anywhere  but can I at least have my phone back?” I say  where’s your Astros jersey  since I didn’t get a good look at what his face looked like. He holds it up and I hand him the phone back. Then I reported to Uber that I returned an item to a rider and got $15 on top of it.   Grand total: $18.75. Miles traveled: Zero. Not bad.
2,uberdrivers,First week  first couple fight and police involvement,"TL;DR Pax wanted to just give me directions to a different address in a different city than the one in the app. Refused to get out  got in physical altercation with his gf  cops called  then he was allowed to berate me before I left.   Long version: Went to pick up pax and he informed me that he needed to take his drunk gf home  but didn't have her new address in her new city  so he put her old address (different city) in the app and would just direct me where to go.   Informed him I couldn't do that  that I needed the destination in the app so uber could charge it correctly  etc.  He says ""I've driven for uber and you're lying. Just drive. She's drunk"". Informed him I couldn't and that he'd have to get a different driver. He tells me to shut the fuck up and drive. Told him i'm canceling the trip and he needed to get out of my car. He says he's not getting out of the car. Informed him I'll have to call the police. He tells me to go ahead. So I do.   While on the phone  on bluetooth speaker with police  his gf attempts to leave the car and he grabs her by her hair and jerks her back into the car. They start struggling over her purse. I'm giving a play by play to police  when in the rearview mirror  I see him hit her in the face. I tell the police and he yells ""she bit me!"". Didn't see the biting  but it's plausible  as they were really starting to fight. Then they just start going at it. The house nearby was having a backyard party  and I could see people  so I just started laying on the horn and thankfully  they came running. As they got to us  the police pull up and the guy jumps out of the car and says ""I got out of the car when she asked!!!"". Total lie and thankfully they could hear him over my bluetooth  so they knew better.   The next hour was me giving a police report  them bringing in an ambulance and 2 fire trucks to assess physical damage  and me on the phone with uber  reporting the issue.   As they wrap up  the gf is taken away in the ambulance and the guy is released to call another uber and go home. They did nothing to him.  Before he calls another uber  he walks over to me to yell at me that I was a fucking bitch  that I could have taken them home  that he's done 3600 drives for uber and knows the rules. Also  that I should have left as soon as he got out of the car and I just wanted to cause him trouble. The cop was standing RIGHT beside him and I ask the cop ""why is he allowed to stand here berating me?? I'm here because I had to give you a report and report this to uber. Wtf?""  Cop says ""he's not under arrest"".  That's it. Nothing else. Finally I wrap up with uber shortly after and I leave.   Wtf? Did I handle that incorrectly? Why wasn't he arrested for pulling her hair and hitting her?? Should he have been allowed to step up to me like that after the incident? Am I in the twilight zone??"
2,lyftdrivers,Fighting couple - customer and abusive boyfriend: End ride  or just rate low?,"At a few hundred rides  I'm still new to this  and have refused to down-rate any passenger. I check passenger ratings just to get a sense of what they mean  so I can set some boundaries in the future  but I don't yet refuse a low rating.  Picked up a passenger at a music venue the other evening. Bonus was around $10  which sadly affected my judgment.  Warning signs:  * There's a designated rideshare pickup area. She was instead on a street corner up the street  in a no-stopping zone along with a couple of cops threatening to give anyone picking up passengers a nice ticket * So I call her  telling her ""Are you at the corner of X and Y? Okay: stay there  and I'll come get you."" * I stop at the corner  with the cops busy a few yards up the street  figuring she'll get in - my car is of a unique and loud color - you can't miss it * I hit ""Arrive"" and 2 minutes elapse - soon a cop is banging on my passenger window  gesturing and mouthing ""get out of here"" * I put the vehicle in gear and am about to drive away  when my genius passenger  who has been standing on the curb right next to my vehicle for 2 minutes  opens the door  saying ""Oh.""  We have a real winner here.  But wait: There's more!  In steps the Angry Boyfriend: an 8-year-old in a 25-year-old body. For the entire ride  he berates her  in not-entirely-coherent terms: ""And the next time I hear from Zoe that you were talking about her behind \[insert random millennial name here\]'s back about Shadrah saying I was ... ""  including threats to get her fired from her job - there seems to be some power dynamic  such as his parents own the company which employs her. Wow. He belches abuse at her for the entire 16-minute ride - loud berating  not yelling.  Best guess: She is flake  boyfriend is abusive douche  she should dump him  and I should have dumped both of them by the side of the road.  Result: $10 fare plus $16 bonus for an 11-mile  15-minute ride (with 4 minutes of initial bedlam finding the rider  plus police anger - never a good thing).  In future  if it's a venue and they're not in the pick-up area  they have poor life skills  so I'll wait in the designated pick-up area  get my $5 if they don't show up  then leave. The $16 bonus clouded my judgment here.  Much to my regret  I did not ding this passenger's rating - and I don't recall her rating before I picked her up.  Two questions:  * I've decided to begin down-rating certain passengers. Based on what I've described  does a ""2"" seem about right? I reserve ""1"" for actual vomiting or damage to the vehicle  but am I being too lenient? * About halfway into the ride  and into his uninterrupted stream of invective  I begin to ponder the idea of ending the ride. Of course  by this time  we're on the freeway and traffic makes it about as difficult to exit and dump them (in a lonely area of junkyards at 1:30 a.m.  of course) as it does to just gut out the remainder of the ride. Should I have ended the ride anyway? Should I have ended it if we were in a nicer part of town?"
2,lyftdrivers,Let me tell you about the fight that broke out while I'm waiting for a PAX,"My first passenger was cool. I picked her up in VB and took her to Norfolk. She seemed to really like my music  singing along with several songs  and was polite and pretty cheerful.     My second passengers were an older couple who I'm assuming had a nice night in Downtown Norfolk. They were quite inebriated--no judgement--so much so that they couldn't figure out how to buckle the seatbelts. I kid you not. I pulled over to the side of the road as they struggled with them and was told ""just go already"" after a minute or two in a frustrated voice.     My third passenger reeked of cigarette smoke (or maybe Mary Jane  it was really a heavy and odd smoke smell). I wouldn't have cared but I'm allergic to cigarette smoke. At one point  he asks for water and as I start to tell him there's water in the seat pocket in front of him  he tells me angrily that he's ""on the phone"" and to ""STFU"" He talked on FaceTime the whole ride and didn't even say hello or goodbye. Oh  but did tell his friends I was a cool driver as I was getting ready to drop him off.      Passenger number four was really nice and wanted to stop to pick up pizza. At the time  I didn't realize that I wouldn't get paid for waiting so I said  sure  that's not a problem at all.      However  it was while he was inside the pizzeria that a fight broke out.     So  this group of four people come out of either a local bar or the pizza shop and one woman is screaming and hollering something fierce at  I'm assuming  some guy. They stop behind my car. She's accusing him of something and the next thing I know  there' about a dozen people shoving each other and posturing behind my car.     At this point  I'm well into my anti-anxiety routine because I'm uncomfortable. Like super uncomfortable. Having survived a physically abusive father  I get triggered really easily when people raise their voices in anger.      Next thing I know  one of them goes up to the car beside me  takes off his jacket  and opens the passenger side door to stow it because he's about to throw down. He's screaming about how he's going to do some serious damage to some other guy's face. His date gets in-between him and his target and hustles him over to his driver's side door. She tries to get him into the car.     While she's doing this  he's struggling to push her away and she's thumping my car with his car door pretty hard. He tells her to stop  she's going to ruin my car to which she replies  ""I don't give a fuck about this bitch's car. Fuck this bitch.""     So I roll down my window and politely ask her to stop fucking up my car. And that's when things went sideways.     She wheels on me  screaming  hurling insults and the woman who started the whole thing appears out of like no where and starts screeching at me. I try to tell her it's not her business and she literally lunges at me  trying to climb in the window and  I can only assume  drag me out of my car.     Thankfully  someone grabs her around the waist and restrains her just enough that her two inch acrylics whiff within an eighth of an inch of my face. She's screaming ""get the fuck out of here!"" repeatedly and threatening to beat the shit out of me.     Meanwhile  I've already got the car in reverse but the main group of the fight is standing practically pressed up against my bumper.     I am a veteran. When I was in training school  I was one of the kids that marched the classes to the school house. I used to call cadence. My classmates used to ""affectionately"" call me the human megaphone. At one point  the TI's told me they could hear my cadence echo from the school house at the end of the troop walk  situated at the bottom of a hill. I just checked  and where CQ is  the schoolhouse is about three quarters of a mile away.     In short  I can be really fucking loud if I want to be.     So without even thinking about it  I belt out  ""Then get the fuck up out of my way!"" at the top of my lungs.  Needless to say  they got out of the way.  I move my car--because I'm not abandoning my passenger--to a different space. And just as I'm parking my car  the cops show up  the whole fight breaks up  people scatter  and it was over.     I don't think driving Lyft is a good idea anymore. Maybe I'm over reacting but this week has been filled with mostly brusque passengers  terrible fairs paying almost nothing  and very few rides. Most don't even acknowledge me with a hello or even say goodbye. One verbally abused me  calling me a ""stupid bitch"" when I asked if there was a specific mall entrance they'd like to be dropped off at.     So I guess if you've read this far  am I over reacting? Should I throw in the towel? I need the extra income but I'm not sure it's worth it. Then again  I do a google search and scores of ""Lyft Driver attacked by passenger(s)"" stories show up."
2,uberdrivers,Lucky strike,Our town has only 2 watering holes that are open past midnight: one is a biker bar and another one is a cartel shithole. Both are located on the same narrow 1-way street in a historical downtown. Biker bar is pretty much self sufficient and carefree  while a cartel shithole is always monitored by at least 2 patrol cars after dark.   I'm parked next to the latter  waiting on a pax (or timer  whichever comes first)  when a dirty van with glowing Uber sign makes an illegal turn and starts driving towards me  totally ignoring the fact that the street is clearly marked as one way and he's moving in a wrong direction.   Oh boy  you must be new. I already see a blackout cop car slowly pulling from the alley behind me  ready to bust his ass… But suddenly there's a pimped up Mustang flying at least 60 in a 15mph zone  blowing a red light  not quite making it into a turn and smashing full speed into a line of parked cars.  In a matter of seconds there were 7 cop cars at the scene  cops shouting  weapons drawn  and everyone lost their interest in that Uber van. At this exact moment the van driver realized that he's driving in a wrong direction  so he slammed on the brakes and did a 16-point (I kid you not) turn  then *sloooowly* noped the fuck out  most likely to change his pants.  PS: When I drove by 20 minutes later  I saw at least 15 cop cars at the scene. Guess that Mustang was loaded.
2,doordash,Customer thinks DoorDash drivers are all part of a collective hivemind who knows everyone's exact delivery preferences.,"Disclaimer: I'm not the greatest when it comes to directions. At all. If I'm getting somewhere  it needs to be very clear where I'm meant to go. Vague directions are just a recipe for disaster. Vague directions at night are ten times worse because for some reason the world looks radically different to me in the dark. So this story is partially my fault.   Went to deliver an order last night to a fucking huge retirement community in my city. I say fucking huge because it's relevant. It was like several different top tier  expensive apartment communities scattered throughout a massive plot of land that could possibly have been its own small town. For now  we'll call the community Retirement Town.  Now  the customer had provided no delivery instructions at all. Just the address. Said address took me to the main office building of Retirement Town. I pulled up into the parking area when I got a text from the customer that said  ""I am at Wellington (name changed).""   I frown and park the car to look around. There is nothing around me except a sign in front of the office building that says  ""Retirement Town Resort Lifestyle Communities."" The office building has large apartments attached to it. Across the street is another sprawl of apartments. There is no Wellington to be found.   Not a problem - she probably was one of the night employees and just set the address to the main building. Usually when this happens  said employee either has someone get the food for them or walks out to meet me.   I circle the Retirement Town main building a bit. No Wellington.  I text the customer. ""Sorry  I'm not sure what ""Wellington"" is?""  Customer: Where are u  Me: I'm in front of an office building with a sign out front that says  ""Retirement Town Resort Lifestyle Communities"".   Customer: Ok ur at the front come around the corner u will see Wellington  When she said ""come around the corner""  I thought she meant that the apartments attached to the office building were called ""Wellington"". So I circled around some more. No dice.   Went to the front desk. Asked WTF was a Wellington. The lady at the desk provided directions similar to my customer  with the addition of saying I needed to make a right and continue around at the stop sign.  There were two stop signs; one for LEAVING the office area  and one for going around. She did not specify  so I kept thinking I'd missed something as I kept circling within the apartment community tied to the office.   Eventually  I texted the customer to ask if she'd be willing to meet me where my GPS had dropped me. As I waited for her to reply  I drove out of the office area and made a right. I don't remember why  but I think I'd reached a point of frustration where I was going to drive everywhere to see if I could find it.  There was Wellington. *Fucking* Wellington.  Turns out  ""around the corner"" was around a bend  then another couple blocks down from the office building where my GPS had dropped me. I admit  me being terrible with directions and also being very tired and trying to navigate an area of town I didn't know existed was partially my bad. But ffs  why hadn't she set the address to the ACTUAL address where she worked? This was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OFFICE BUILDING AND APARTMENT COMMUNITY FROM WHERE SHE SET THE ADDRESS.  I park back at Retirement Town main building  where she meets me. She's in the car with her friend  and both of them look at me like I just vomited on their shoes. The customer starts explaining to me how to get to her building if I ever had to deliver there again. Wording it in a way that implied I should've known this  even though there were no fucking notes in the delivery instructions. As if we *all* should know this  or if maybe she'd had previous delivery people come by who didn't have trouble. Her friend kept an eye on me the whole time  looking like she was waiting on me to try something.  I just stayed polite and nodded and said I'd keep that in mind and handed her her food and drink and drove off. Went home for the night.  Here's a few tips for anyone ordering food to their workplace:  * Add fucking delivery instructions if getting to you is going to require some extra steps.  * Put in the correct address of where you work. Especially if you work in one of several different office buildings. Don't just slap in a generic address and hope for the best.  * If the address and your location are different  at least TRY to be where you said you'll be.  * Doordash drivers do not have a collective database of everyone's exact location and where they want their crap delivered.  * **Add your shit to the delivery instructions because that's why it's there.**"
2,Lyft,(CA) My friend got physically removed by his Lyft driver and then got into a fist fight with him,"I posting this on behalf of a friend who had an issue with his driver last night.  First of all I think I should mention that he drives both for Uber and Lyft. He says that he was riding back to his home last night and arguing with his wife on the phone. As they were getting closer to his destination he says that he asked the driver 'which road he was taking' since there has been an on going road work on the route that the driver was following. He is a sweet guy and I have no doubt that his intentions where good but English is not his native language so he might not have come across polite  I don't know I wasn't there but he says that he was not yelling or raising his voice  he was just asking him a question.  He says that the driver told him ""whatever route the GPS is telling me"". I think that the driver was already irritated with him arguing on the phone in another language  which is what the driver told him later on  I will come back to this  and he might have felt being questioned and maybe even offended I am not sure. My buddy asks the driver to take the next street as the street that the GPS is asking them is closed. At that point the driver asks him to leave the car and says ""you were already arguing on the phone when you got into my car and just leave already"". My buddy doesn't want to leave  they are about 2-3 blocks away from his destination and he says just drive me to the address on the GPS. The driver pulls over and says ""GTFO my car"". At this point my buddy pulls out his phone and asks him to repeat what he said but the driver doesn't do that  it is not a video btw  he was voice recording. The driver gets out of his seat  physically removes my buddy from the car and rips his shirt off and scratches his arm while doing so. My buddy gets upset and they get into a fist fight. Once they were done he walks to his place and receives an email from Lyft saying that his account is closed while the incident is being investigated.  Now I am not a driver myself nor do I know much about the rules but what should be his next steps. Again  he is not from the US so he didn't think of calling the police when he got removed from the car but can the driver get physical with the passenger? Since account is closed he can't drive either  so there is that :)   Thanks for reading. He is just looking for a guidance."
2,doordash_drivers,Door Dash Driver Involved in Shooting 17-APR-2020 (Vehicle struck by round),Hello   I know that I’ve previously posted as a Door Dasher advising against entering apartment complexes or places dashers feel unsafe and did not receive entirely supportive or understanding feedback – both in light of COVID19 hazards AND general safety precautions of entering stranger or foreigner complexes and areas to deliver customers food.  Needless to say  I want to take the opportunity to once again emphasize how important our safety as Door Dashers is  especially given the growing climate of fear and instability in the United States  both as a scholar and as a human being.  Your safety is the most important thing  first and foremost  and also your customers safety.  Last night around 11PM EST I was speaking with and handing a customer food when a shooting started about 17 feet or less away from us. I immediately pushed the customer to go inside right away  and obviously ran for my life – included in other images and pictures.  To my surprise  during the shootout my vehicle (left hazard lights on) was not stolen.  However  my vehicle was shot.  Thankfully  I am unharmed in this specific instance.  Once again  I encourage total  constant vigilance when approaching  interacting with customers  and being mindful of your surroundings at all times.  These are difficult times. People are desperate – many recently coming into “money.”  Please be safe.  Thank you  Mods: feel free to cross-post or contact for further verification. Obviously  a police report has been made  and my dashcam was also running during the entire counter before  during  and after the shooting – including when my vehicle is struck by a round.

2,uberdrivers,Joined the elusive two star club today and had my longest ride all in one,I drive in Bloomington  IN  a college town  because I’m in college and it’s a good way to make money on the side. I did a couple of rides around town today like normal and then got a request for a 45+ minute ride. It’s the end of the semester so I figured I’d be giving a ride to Indianapolis airport. Boy was I wrong. Picked up the pax  a freshman girl from the dorms  and when I start the ride it shows me she’s going to Cincinnati  a 2.5 hour drive away.   Eh I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the day so I figured why the hell not. As we get going I ask if she has a preference on music  she doesn’t  so I put on my classic rock station. I start driving and attempt to make conversation but it’s clear she’s not interested. That was my first bad impression.   Side note: for anyone not familiar with the area there’s only one way to go to Cincinnati from Bloomington. You go to Columbus first  then greensburg  then get on I-74 the rest of the way. This was the way my Uber app took me (this will be important later)  Along the way we hit construction traffic on I-74 slowed us down maybe 15-20 minutes. We made passing comments about the traffic and how it sucks. Eventually I see what’s slowing everyone down. There was a semi flipped on its side on the side of the road and everyone was slowing down to look as they passed. Eventually got through it and got her to her destination. As we pull up and she’s about to get out she says thank you so much for the ride I really appreciate you driving me this far.   Ride ends and I see I got $160 fare from the ride and then it pops up that she tipped me $30 wohoo!!  I think that’s the end but then I notice my rating has dropped down from a 4.98 to 4.96 (I don’t care about my rating as long as its above 4.9). I click on the details and see the elusive two star rating and a report for “trip route”. Wtf I think to myself. How are you going to complain about the route after I was just following the app  you didn’t mention anything as I was driving  and you thank me after we get there.   Anyway  that’s my rant over. Just felt like sharing how my day went.
3,UberEATS,California Class Action Lawsuit,Uber is not adhering to California Vehicle Code 4606. I recently was notified by the Uber app that registration was expiring. I registered online  complied with DMV and registered on time. Unbeknownst to me  DMV only gives a receipt of the registration which is valid in the courts and for chp in order to drive until you receive the official paperwork  which can take up to 30 days. Once the driver registers online or at DMV  there is no way to reverse the process and go to a kiosk for same day print of tags and official registration papers. Once a driver  like myself  who didn't know about the kiosk or that DMV wouldn't print you out an official form  the driver is stuck waiting for the paperwork from the DMV and out of work for up to 30 days. I went to the local Uber office and they said they can do nothing about it and that many people in the last 4 years have complained about it. Why is Uber not adhering to the rules and how is it fair to the driver to not be able to work for up to 30 days when complying with DMV? Many people  like myself  rely on UberEats to pay their bills and rent. Uber is unnecessarily putting drivers through this situation and not paying them. They should have a large red alert that says you MUST register at a kiosk since we do not comply with California's vehicle code section 4606 or allow the driver to upload DMV's official receipt and give them 30 days to upload the official paperwork when it arrives via mail. This has caused me to lose up to $1500 a week plus bonuses. I think Uber should be responsible for this for every driver that had experienced this issues. Am I the only one?
3,uber,May 8th strike,Whether you’re a part time or full time driver  I ask all of you to unite for one day. As most of you know  Uber’s IPO will be coming out on the 9th. They are estimated to raise $10 BILLION DOLLARS! As drivers  we are the backbone of the company. We are the ones grinding it out everyday  taking people to the airport  hospitals  relieving the stress of people so they don’t have to drive drunk  and transporting people to their jobs. Without the one million rideshare drivers in America  this would not be possible. If all rideshare drivers were to not work for one day  it would impact over five million people needing the services.   The 25% rate cuts have been devastating to the livelihood of thousands of drivers. They are unable to feed their families  pay their bills  and many are resorting to sleeping in their cars because they cannot afford housing. While the CEO of Uber is expected to get a $50 MILLION DOLLAR bonus for the company going public  drivers are working almost twice as much to earn what they did a few months ago.   I’m hoping this May 8th strike will have a huge impact  not just on Uber  but to our passengers who support us  and we can make a change for the better.   We need to stand in solidarity and show our strength in numbers.   Please stand with me and let’s keep our apps off for one day.   King of Uber 👑  Please share this post with everyone.
3,uberdrivers,Lyft and uber aren't gonna raise wages  u want higher pay  protest against the customers tipping ethics instead,Let's face it lyft and uber DO NOT care about you. Have you racked up 10 000 rides? Have a 4.9 or 5 rating?... guess what  Tom a brand new driver tommorow will start tommorow and earn exactly as much as you do after u been doing this for 2 years... go ahead and quit.. theres 10 more Tom's that's will replace you.  We as drivers deserve more pay... WITH OUT A DOUBT.. but lyft and uber ain't gonna increase the per mile rate... not now  not tomorrow  not a year from now.  I'm not gonna side with the bs reports out there that I make less than minimum wage  and I dont think many drivers do... but I for sure dont make enough for what I do... and how much the customers pay after getting my cut.  When this rideshare convenience started back in the day  drivers were making $2 - $3 a mile  and uber planted it into the consumers head that tipping was not necessary.. yea maybe so.. when back then every ride was literally about a 2x- 3x surge cost wise according to today's rate...and drivers were being paid fairly .. oh yea and the companies were growing and throwing mad bonuses for a driver just to be online and not even complete a single ride.... for those of you not in the now.. just being online for an hr back then and not even doing a  single ride even guranteed you $20-$25 hr +.. these were the promos to build these companies that now essentially slaves work for.  Long story short  I see these protests against lyft and uber to raise there wages  it's not gonna happen.. but if we can protest about the tipping culture and how a 5 star driver can do 20 rides in a day and only recieve 2 or 3 tips... we can get the attention of the public. We rightfully so deserve more money... and if every passanger tipped min a $1 or $2... this gig can be very sustainable for many people
3,grubhubdrivers,What prevents a single or multi day strike?,On GH’s website it says they process 457 000 daily orders.  Could you imagine the impact if for just one day that number was 0?  GH ain’t just gonna laugh  shrug their shoulders and say “Oh well”.  They will be forced to listen and to actually make positive changes for all drivers.     In my situation   I am willing to sacrifice one or even a couple days for the greater good.  Who cares if I miss out on $200 for a few days missed if it means a much great impact down the road.  What is preventing all drivers coming together and saying  “Hey  we aren’t being treated fairly.  We aren’t employees and cannot be fired for missing work.  Just for one day let’s not work.”  I highly doubt GH is going to terminate/deactivate hundreds of thousands of drivers and hire a new batch.  They’ll be forced ASAP to actually make changes that benefit us as drivers.  And not just Pay.  It could be anything.    So what the heck is stopping this?

3,InstacartShoppers,Do you think the removal of the quality bonus is retaliation for the strike?,I’m not making any accusations here.  Maybe this is all just a coincidence.    Anyways  I didn’t participate in the strike at all.  I worked because I know how to play the game.  I worked because I understand that  as an Independent Contractor  I’m not being forced to do anything.  And I worked because Instacart is Apoorva’s company and he is free to run it however he wants.    I don’t agree or disagree with any choices he makes because that’s his business.  I’m not an investor so I’m not providing any financial incentive for him to listen to me.  If the partnership I have with his company  Instacart  turns out to no longer benefit me  then I will walk away.  If you feel the partnership you have with Instacart is no longer beneficial  then you have the freedom to walk away as well.    I partner with many different companies and I recommend everyone else do the same.  I also would recommend that everyone (especially those complaining) explore their options with regards to starting their own company locally.  I don’t care for your complaining but I don’t doubt your abilities and I believe that  especially in this day and age  you can build something from the ground up and be successful.  Whether you agree or disagree with what I’m saying  it’s all good.  I just hope everyone out there is finding a way to achieve success.
3,uberdrivers,Why and why not strike with vengeance ON our greedy boss? IPO? HELL NO!!,My name is Izzy I drive for uber for 4 years.  I rely on driving to pay rent  buy food and just survive.   .   When I first started with uber I was working 60 hours a week which is still a lot but I was averaging 2k a week. Now I'll be lucky if I get 1000 for the same work and time.   .    Every year everything goes up in prices rent  insurance  gas   food and uber rates keep decreasing making us work more and more to satisfy their greedy business model.  They want us to help them reach their main goal which is to look good for their IPOs so they can make 120 billion overnight by forcing us to work long hours by making small inexpensive trips to help them gain market share. Uber also makes more money on short trips because they double dip by taking the initial rider's fee and half of the minimum fare fee.   .    All they really care about is market share  how much they can squeeze out of cheap labor  with no overhead costs on their end of the spectrum. OUR expenses.. Our time and hard working backs so they can in turn look good for their IPO and make billions.   ·      We’re totally at the mercy of these companies. Few weeks ago overnight Uber cut drivers rates by 25% in LA – with no input from drivers. They are only paying us 60 cents a mile. Before it was 79 cents per mile which was still super low poverty level considering we are running our vehicles to the ground rather quickly.. 2-3 years. Not factoring  gas which also went up a whopping 20% since the cut and still going up.   They decrease the mileage to force us to do short trips all day. They arguing we would get bonuses.  Bonuses are ridiculously low.. About 1 dollar extra per ride after 70 to 100 rides.. Barely even paying for gas.   ·      My landlord isn’t going to cut rent by 25%  which means I need to drive longer hours and I already drive 50+ hours a week.   People think that gig workers are doing this on the side or for extra money  when it’s really something thousands of people rely on for their primary income.   ·      At the LAX lot  I see drivers who are immigrants  people with disabilities  elderly people who can’t afford to retire – really vulnerable workers who are working without a safety net.   On busy days at the airport such Thursday to Mondays evenings.  Uber Drivers have to wait on queue between 30 to 40 minutes to get one a ping request.  It takes approximately 18 to 25 minutes to get to their terminal due to traffic from the uber holding waiting lot  and 10 to 15 min to drive off the airport.  After about 2 hour to successfully lock in a ride.   We have to pray and hope that this ride takes us more than 20 miles to be even slightly profitable.   If they are less than 10 miles in which we would be only making $10 dollars as per uber guaranteed minimum pick up rates at the airport.  About 30 to 50% of those pings are shorts.. So drivers only makes $10 after that long wait without factoring gas/overheads. 80% riders don't even tip due to Uber old mentality. Uber knows all of these things and they don't care.. It's about making the user's / riders happy and  creating a dominant market share to look good for their IPO so they can make billions on the driver's hard backs. If uber don't care about the drivers.. Drivers will care less about uber and riders.   Taxi cabs don’t leave the airport with less than $40 dollars guaranteed even if they are going less than one mile            WE are constantly being monitored and supervised by the Uber app. They want us to be contractors but they can easily cut the rates overnight without us having a say.  They obligate us to accept all of these terms they throw at us or else we can’t go online and work.  We can get deactivated (FIRED) if we call customers to find out where they are going.   Sometimes it’s not profitable to go to certain areas especially if that might send you far because that means you have to drive back empty.  (Deadheaded) There is no transparency.  They want us to work like slaves.  They say they care but they really don’t.  They like to make the riders/ customers happy but they treat us like modern day slave robots. ·      Uber  Lyft  etc. know how vulnerable drivers are and they exploit that.  ·      Every driver knows someone who was deactivated for a minor problem or misunderstanding.  ·      Deactivation means your income is gone  and  if you’re leasing from the company  your car is too.  ·      The companies don’t care; they know they can just replace you with someone else. They hire new drivers about 300 daily saturating the market more and more.. They make more money from us on small short rides due to their booking fees thus making 45% every single time.   ·      That’s their business model  make drivers disposable  get people hooked on cheap rides and take over the market.  ·      Now  with these IPOs coming up  it’s only going to get worse. I’m afraid they will keep cutting the rates even more. ·      Uber and Lyft’s Silicon Valley workers are going to make billions overnight with the promise that they become profitable for investors. ·      They’ve never made a profit yet and they already treat us as disposable. What’s going to happen next? ·      All of these drivers are giving their lives to billion dollar companies and they deserve the same rights as any other employee. 1. Huge risk. You are constantly on the busiest road with the most aggressive drivers in the nation. So many things can go wrong  Personal injury or even death  Property damage  handicapped for rest of your life  Financial ruined for rest of your life  Insurance hike  falsely deactivation  Random rate cut and more.   2. Zero Benefits. No health insurance  no sick leave  no paid vacation  no 401K  no social security  the list goes on.  3. Not everyone is cut out to be a rideshare drivers. Those with terrible driving records and criminal records are out  Those who are afraid of risks are out. Those bad at navigating  lack of interpersonal skills soon will be eliminated by the 4.6 rating barrier.  4. While almost everyone has a car  Drivers are not getting compensated a single penny running their relatively expensive tool (comparing to other jobs) into the ground. A reliable used car run about $10 000  Now imagine the company you work for tell you that you have to discard $10 000 worth of property every 3-5 years   NYC got regulated.. San Francisco..   They are now making decent wages more than twice of LA prices maybe even triple.   Why?  They got together and fought back.. Are you going to fight back?   Everyone needs to participate on this next stike make copies I would say 100 each at least and give it out to everyone you see on the street   The only way we can stop these companies exploitation of modern day slave work is for us to dissimnate  unite and fight back.      I care about these drivers  I see them every day and I fight for them on the airport lot  and I’m fighting for them here. I hope this unify us and make them feel our pain..  All we want is fair pay  dignity and respect.  “If enough drivers participate  they will have an impact ” says NYU business professor Arun Sundararajan  who is generally bullish on the prospects for Uber  Lyft  and other “gig-economy” companies. “Worker protests by Uber and Lyft drivers get far more attention than any other labor action in the world right now.”
3,uber,For riders and drivers against the strike: free markets have their solutions,Strikes are part of the free market for bargaining power. Minimum wage is one of the few rules you set for the game and let the markets play. Without these  you should own slaves and be slaves.  From NYT  everybody can drive to make a living so the lawmakers limit the supply artificially so drivers and the city can make decent profits while pax complains a lot. It's hard to break the lawmakers.  But Uber with an unlimited supply of money broke the model  sometimes operate illegally with the support of the public. Early drivers were happy and pax were happy.  Pax are afraid that price will go up if drivers are paid more. That is narrow thinking. The market is a lot more than that. Yes  if the price goes up  some riders cannot afford it  but I won't call them crybabies. It's a market force. If drivers are being paid 40/50 cents a mile the one left won't be familiar with the US language and roads and all cars will be crappy.  And sorry for the drivers who said the strike was useless. But we may be the 1st global strike. Media couldn't have enough of it. Senators and representatives jump in to support. You can argue that Uber/Lyft reply with less cut of the fare if only temporarily. Or you can argue that they reply with reduced rates. So whether you support the strike or not  you feel the success and you feel the pain. I'll call that a success  LOL.  Uber could fail but I don't see how impossible to replace it. How difficult are local taxi dispatchers to update their phone system to give you an app with GPS? Taxies are expensive because the lawmakers want it that way. Now it's already broken so Uber isn't necessary.
3,uberdrivers,I was at the L.A. Strike against Uber today and I was disappointed in many of the drivers there. Before you just flippantly downvote this  at least read the rest of the post to see why I was disappointed., I hope the L.A. Strike is doing some damage to the company  I sincerely do  but I was there earlier and I was pretty disappointed in so many drivers.   I saw striking drivers harassing other drivers who probably didn't even know a strike was taking place. I saw a guy throw an empty coffee cup at a passing Uber car. I saw many thumbs down  people booing passing Uber cars  and lots of people flipping other drivers off.  I don't think it's productive to alienate other drivers  especially without knowing their situation. Many drivers drive for Lyft and Uber together  and none of the harassing drivers knew whether the other drivers were driving a Lyft passenger where the Uber app is obviously off. I though that was the idea: Keep the Uber app off... at least the picket signs said so.
3,uberdrivers,LA Strike Observation,First off  I am driving today. I wish I could afford to not and strike but the reality is I can’t. Sorry. You can side eye me or ignore this post from here if it upsets you.   That being said  as I had suspected this strike wasn’t very effective in terms of disruption. I saw some protestors at the airport. The waiting lot was pretty desolate but I’ve seen it like that on other days too.   I am not sure if LA just wasn’t very effective in getting the word out — I only heard about it because someone scrawled it in sharpie on the port-a-potty at the airport lot on Monday. I wasn’t even sure if it was old graffiti and was referring to last May 8.   Today driving was pretty much the same as any other day. There weren’t any crazy surges because of lack of drivers. The passengers I talked to had no trouble getting a ride. It was pretty much a normal day.   The other thing that I think is missing is a clear agenda. I am all for workers’ rights and I am upset at the rate cuts and how shitty they treat us drivers but I don’t know if there is a clear set of demands.   Yes  more pay. Great. But in return for what? I keep seeing the main argument against this by drivers on here being that getting employee status will upend the flexibility and control of our job. I started driving because of the ability to create my own schedule. Of course that has meant having to fit in more and more hours just to make enough to hit my nut.   I posed this question to this forum a while back  but I think creating a rideshare guild (or gig economy guild) would be a better solution. It would be like the entertainment guilds that protect workers’ rights but also maintain the freelance contractor status.   Lastly  I think if we were to organize a strike  we need to be more disruptive. I was reminded of the protests that shut down the airport when trump first announced the travel ban. I think it would be a much more powerful act if drivers united and planned a caravan that shut down LAX for a few hours. Have a clear list of demands and make a real impact. It wouldn’t be about arguing with each other about who’s a scab or a shill or a fool amongst ourselves. If I saw an endless caravan of drivers slowly circling the terminal from Century to Sepulveda  making it impossible for riders and drivers to connect at the airport and making our voices heard  I would definitely join the parade.   But waving signs on the side of the road and yelling seems pretty ineffective ultimately. The last strike came and went. Uber went public anyway. Uber kept the wages shitty.   Just my thoughts. Go ahead and blast me if you feel the need. Thanks for reading.
4,Upwork,Anyone interested in joining a weekly accountability group?,I'm thinking about putting together a weekly group accountability video calls for people who work remotely.  The idea is one focused weekly call with 3 other professionals who work in a similar field and have similar goals. You each get 15 minutes to explain what you do  what your current goals are  and what your current obstacles are.  The idea is that it will help you set professional goals and then stay accountable to them through the coming weeks and months. It is also a chance to give and receive professional guidance  feedback and support.  Perhaps most importantly  being self-employed can be lonely and isolating sometimes. I think spending some time with a team of people that support you  even if you don't work with them  would really help. In the short terms because of the lockdown but also in the long run.  This next part is entirely optional  but I think it would help keep things focused. In addition to a weekly group video session  we can each stake some money towards our professional progress that month (say $20)  at the end of each call we rate each other's professional progress for that week.  At the end of the month  the person who made the most professional progress (as rated by your peers) wins the money. We would need 10-25 people to do this  so it would be about $500 prize. The prize isn’t really the point  accountability and a sense of community are  but the prize will help everyone stay focused.  I can figure out a form so that people are paired with people in the same field  similar goals and similar levels of experience. I can also spend some time figuring out an escrow system  a way to rate each other after calls and a leaderboard.  If I spend the time figuring it all out  would anyone be interested?  Please leave a comment below if you are interested so that I can gauge whether or not it is worth putting something like this together.  Any other feedback on the idea  or ways it could be improved  are most welcome.  Stay safe.
4,Nanny,Nap fights,How long do you fight toddlers on naps when they're clearly tired and just being stubborn? I'm watching twin 2.5 NKs this week while parents are out of town and I just fought one of them to nap for almost an hour. Her mom lays with her to get her to sleep (ugh) but mom and I have always had different things we do when putting them down for bed and it's never been a problem. However  they've recently moved out of cribs  which complicates matters because now she can get out of bed. Anyways  for the last 4 days  I've gotten her to sleep with minimal fighting it (we sing two songs and then I lay with her for two minutes and then get up - sometimes she's sleeping  sometimes still awake - and if she's awake  I tell her I'll check on her but she always falls asleep right away). But today  she fussed and cried when I walked away. I told her I'd check on her if she laid quietly. And she did so I sang a song and she fell asleep. But then she woke up right after I left and she cried again so I reminded her I only check on quiet kids so she was quiet. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes until she was no longer able to stay quiet and was sobbing for mom. So to salvage her and her sister's nap  I sat next to her until she fell deeply asleep. All told  it took me an hour and I was CRANKY by the end of it. (It doesn't help that she woke me up 5 times last night with this kind of shit). Anyways. They've always been such good sleepers and I've never had this much trouble getting kids to nap. Should I have just called it quits or laid with her earlier? Ugh. I'm just so frustrated with this whole week (they sleep way worse now that they'te in big kid beds so I'm tired and annoyed that parents essentially waited for me to be here this week to transition them to big kid beds).
4,Fiverr,Anyone interested in joining a weekly accountability group? [OTHER],Anyone interested in joining a weekly accountability group?  I'm thinking about putting together weekly accountability group video calls for people who work for themselves.  Working for yourself can be lonely and isolating  now more so than ever. I think spending some time with a team of people that support you professionally  even if you don't work with them  would really help. In the short terms  because of the lockdown  but also in the long run.  The idea is one focused weekly call with 4-6 other professionals who work in a similar field and have similar goals. You each get 10-15 minutes to explain what you do  what your current goals are  and what your current obstacles are. I'll do my best to only match people with others who have similar levels of experience.  The idea is that it will help you stay on track by setting your professional goals and then stay accountable to them through the coming weeks and months. It is also a chance to give and /or receive professional guidance  feedback and support.  I can figure out a form so that people are paired with people in the same field  similar goals and similar levels of experience.  Anyone interested?  Please leave a comment below or DM me so that I can gauge whether or not it is worth putting something like this together.  Any other feedback  or ways the idea could be improved  are most welcome.
4,Nanny,“Fight like a mother”,This is a throwaway because at the end of the day I absolutely adore my nanny family and I just need to get this off my chest.  I have two nanny kids. 4M and 1F. 1F has a very rough first year. She spent months in the NICU and while she has a positive outlook going forward  she will never be 100%  and we are still not sure what exactly her life will look like - the quality and length of it should be good  but we are still learning about the extent of her needs.  MB has gone above and beyond finding her the best (and extra therapies)  advocating for her  fundraising  getting second opinions - you name it  she’s probably done it. For 1F.  4M on the other hand... it’s like 1F has been so sick that 4M must be healthy. He’s so “brave” (like his sister  of course) and “understanding beyond his years” (about his sister  of course) and “has no adverse effects from their hospital stay” (besides crying every time there’s a transition and the stress induced stutter he’s developed).   She recently said to me “I feel like I missed out on all of 3” (the kids birthdays are super close together). And the fact is - she did. I attended all of the school parties. I took kiddo on his first roller coaster ride  his first zoo trip  last day of school and first day of summer camp  potty trained - you name it  I probably did it this year. And I know that in part I did all of that because MB and DB knew that 4M was in good hands with an adult who adores him.  But she recently posted online about all of the advocating she’s done for 1F and ended it by saying “fight like a mother!” And just - I have been advocating like crazy for 4M. He needs to see a speech therapist and a play therapist and needs to spend more quality time with his parents that doesn’t revolve around 1F and her diagnosis. And it has been slow and required me to push to get all of this done. It has gotten done though and 4M will hopefully benefit greatly from the services he is receiving.   Fight like a mother  for both of your kids.  End rant.  And I do feel awful for MB and DB and the situation they’re in and I would never want to be in their position and all of that. And I know MB has some mental health issues stemming from the 4 months baby girl spent in the NICU and all of the trauma that entailed. And MB knows exactly how I feel about her needing to spend quality time with 4M and they are genuinely trying  especially now that there is a clear medical plan in place for 1F. I just. Ugh. 4M being healthy does not make his needs any less important than 1F.
4,Nanny,Fight between two live-in Nannies.,This is going to be long. Hopefully some of you read this:)  I’m a live in Nanny. There are two of us. Let’s call the other Nanny  Blue. Blue has had problems with the previous Nanny. In fact I’ve had to ask Blue to stop talking about the other Nanny badly because it made me uncomfortable. I didn’t know the other nanny well and she seemed like such a sweet person when I was being interviewed  therefore I didn’t feel the need to hear the gossip. Wasn’t interested. That was a red flag for me.   Over the past few months I’d notice anything I’d share with Blue would be told to the Mom. For example  I had met a friend and I hung out with them a few times and then Blue asks me “did you move out here/get this job because of this person” I said no. I just met this person I wanted to start making friends. Next day Blue tells the Mom about this conversation. Mom just brings it up. Now I feel weird because I don’t want the Mom to think I moved out here for that. The list goes on  even little things like if I wanted to go the mall  Mom asks “I heard you were going to the mall”.  I’m a very private person. I just don’t appreciate people telling my business. Blue has already gotten in trouble for eavesdropping on the NK’s monitor and listening in on the parents conversations. She constantly barges into the room when I’m with 10moF and it is so annoying. She doesn’t have any boundaries.   Over the past few weeks I’ve had discussions with myself about my life and wondering if I would want to move back home. I shared these thoughts with Blue. (I know I let my guard down) I told her specifically that this was between us and I was thinking of moving back but I don’t have any plans. Not even a week ago I told her I’m going to stay and try and establish myself here. This is important **** I applied for a second job to meet friends+make more money. I got the job Thursday. I was so happy. Blue and and discussed how we need to switch shifts for about two days out of the week so I can go work. Blue works mornings  I work afternoon-evenings. So we would switch  I do mornings and she’d do evenings. We agreed to this. She even helped me pick out a interview outfit and was excited I got the job.  Mom comes in this morning and said so I have a question  are you leaving us? And I said what? Did Blue say something? She confirmed. I said I was loosely talking and if I had decided to leave I would give months in advance. But I don’t even have a concrete plan  absolutely nothing it’s just a thought. Even when the Mom and I were talking Blue barges in and the Mom asks her to leave. You can clearly hear talking from the hallway. Everything was so awkward and I felt so weird.   Anyways  Blue leaves the house after she’s asked to leave and I send her a text. To sum it up I respectfully told her how it wasn’t her place to share what I told her in confidentiality. I also mentioned that I fully competent to speak for myself and if I needed to I would have told the Mom myself. I told her after so many instances like this I don’t trust to have anything but a superficial conversation with her and ask if she keep anything else I told her  private.   She responded “Sorry you feel that way but I didn’t bring it up to Mom. If you want to set a boundary  fine you are coworker. So I feel like I’m not going to change my schedule. I will stick with mornings.”  I replied with this “Ok so I guess your comfortable with implying Mom was lying. And because I feel the need to call you out on your nosiness you want to sabotage my chance at the other job. This isn’t high school Blue  grow up.”   Blue: “You know I didn’t really care. You do what you want. If it doesn’t involves 10moF or something with the house. Then we don’t need to talk.”  Me: “oh most definitely”  I know this is really long and if you read/skimmed this far maybe you have an opinion? I know I could’ve come off more professionally but I was so sick of her sharing my business especially this instance because one: I told her not to tell anyone please  these are just thoughts. Two: I told her not even a week ago I had decided to stay.
4,AirBnB,A guest staying on my property picked a fight with me  threatened my husband  and was all around belligerent. I don't know how to handle the upcoming review.,"I co-host a stand alone efficiency that is on the property I live on. I pretty much do everything  the host collects the money and does some maintenance. I am new to this  and enjoy it  but still am learning.  The host set up the listing before I took over  and there were no rules except the common con parties no smoking"". Anyone could book the place without any requirements or someone could book for another person  no questions asked. It turned into the wild west of Airbnbs as you could imagine  and I've been slowly adding some rules for the sake of me  the other tenants on the property  and safety of the guests.   For the past month  we've had a couple in their 70s staying in the unit. Their daughter booked them the place under her account  which I knew wasn't a great idea. The couple brought 2 small dogs which they've let roam around the yard  barking  and terrorizing anyone who comes near. Eventually  one of the dogs came at my dog and I told the man that my dog isn't friendly with others  which he ignored.   A couple days later  after discussing it with the host  I sent the daughter a message requesting her to ask her parents to please keep their dogs on a leash  that although I'm sure the dogs are well behaved  we have 3 other dogs on the property and I wanted to avoid any unneeded conflicts. She said  sure  no problem. That was a few days ago.  Last night  my husband answers a phone call on our balcony  and comes back inside. He's briefly on the phone when I hear someone yelling from downstairs and loud rattling. I look out the window and it's the guest screaming at our window  ""You got something to say to me?!?"" and hitting our metal staircase. Apparently  when he heard my husband on the phone  he thought my husband was shit talking him. We were both thoroughly confused at what this guy's problem was.  It escalated from there. He threatened to break my husband's hand  spat at him  called him every name in the book  called him a snitch for saying something about the dogs being leashed. I interjected and introduced myself as the co-host  which I thought they already knew. He told me I was a mean person for mentioning the dogs to his daughter  that I gave her a bad review (he thought the message was a review I guess  had the explain to him that's not how it works)  that I use the shared laundry room too much  that I get too many deliveries  and I'm not a nice neighbor for just coming to him about the dogs. I explained everything I do is in writing for reasons like this and I would not now or ever knock on his door to inform him of the rules.   He was also upset that the other tenants on the property weren't socializing out in the yard with him and he brought a BBQ looking forward to hanging out with people. We never hang out in the yard  we are working people in our 30s with things to do  this isn't Melrose Place. Just completely delusional and weird. The list of complaints went on.   After he told me that he lives on the property and I explained that he is only a guest here  I realized he had no clue that there are rules and his daughter never bothered to tell him that. Besides being clueless   he's an entitled asshole who expects way more than a $50/night Airbnb offers. I got him to calm down  but he called the host who could not care less. He then proceeded to spend the rest of the evening trying to rally my neighbors against me. Laughable.  If it were up to me  I'd make him leave for threatening violence. But the host doesn't want to do that  says he's only got a week left. So  I guess my question is how am I supposed to handle this when review time comes around? Do I leave a bad review on his daughter's profile even though she never stayed here? And can she review us although she was never here? I'm guessing yes  she can. Is this something I might have to contact Airbnb about.  By the way  this is absolutely the last time I'm allowing anyone to book on behalf of someone else. I've already discussed this with the host."
4,Nanny,What time do you want to meet lady strikes again.,I want to preface by saying that the first conversation happened a month ago  even though I posted it yesterday.   So this lady messages me on an app out of nowhere last night   Lady: “did u need 300 a wk”  Me: “For a 30-40 hour workweek  yes”  Lady: “300 a wk???” Lady: “text me 555-5555”  So I switch to text  Me: “Hi lady  this is Caightie. Yes I need to make $300 a week to pay my bills.”  Lady: “I can do that but need your help even when new baby is here my husband owns his own business so he cant step away a long time” Lady: “Now do u have kids or are you pregnant” Lady: “engaged?” Lady: “My schedule varies so times will too”  Me: “I'm not married or engaged  I don't have any kids and I'm not pregnant.” Me: “My schedule is fairly open  but I  will need to know a week in advance so that I can make my own arrangements”  Lady: “Okay that's fine when should we schedule you to come meet the family”  Me: “I've picked up a part time job  I can do after 4 Mon-Fri and I'm free all day most saturdays”  Lady: “That won't work for me I need afternoon houra”  Me: “I don't have a weekday afternoon off until the week of the 29th  I can do a Saturday or Sunday afternoon”  Lady: “hours”  Me: “I thought we were discussing an interview time?”  Lady: “I need someone more for 1st shift hours”  Me: “If you decide to hire me  I'll put in my two weeks notice and then be available full time”  Lady: “I'm due in 2 wks so it wouldn't work I need someone asap”  Me: “I'm sorry  I won't be available part time until the week of the 29th  or full time until the week of Aug 5”  Lady: “That's gonna be too late”  20 minutes later -  Lady: “I’ll continue my search”  2 hours after that -  Lady: “Ok put your 2 weeks in a.s.a.p I have my old sitter coming back until you can start”  Me “Hang on  I appreciate your interest  and that you're on a time restriction  but we've never met in person. We need to do a proper interview to make sure I'm a good fit for your family's needs.”    I legitimately don’t know why I texted her back in the first place. I should not have. All I’ve gotten are more red flags for my trouble.
4,AirBnB,Rat Infestation -- No Action taken by Airbnb to Remediate,Hi r/Airbnb  Over the holidays I stayed in the Adams Morgan area of DC. We arrived Christmas Eve to a quaint first level apartment home. We noticed a few things that were off putting  but nothing that was a get me the hell out of here moment: paint chips on the ground through multiple floors  personal belongings in the entryway  unemptied trash  and just small signs of an unkempt home. Only things that you wish were different  but on Christmas Eve at 10 PM don't want to bother the owner about.   We are out of the house for a few days visiting family  and on the third day we come home to some visitors. One rat scurrying across the floor  holding a dead comrade in his mouth. Thats when we started noticing something was off. We went into the kitchen  the food we had there was torn apart and eaten. Through that night we heard the common sounds of rodents in the walls through all three floors of the property.  The next day we find a dead rat out on the back patio and I contact the owner for a refund due to he living conditions. I mentioned that the last tenant made a comment about a similarly dead rodent on the back porch a month prior and with the level of decay it's safe to say it's the same dead rat that's been around all month.  Couple the dead rats with the buckling hard wood floors  large bags of rat poison hanging on exposed pipes  and the unkempt nature of the place  I'm guessing the renter would be understanding and offer compensation. They offered 50% off one night as long as I did not give a bad review. I contact Airbnb and they are not able to hold the renter accountable.  Fast forward to today and nothing has been done to give compensation for the issue. What is my path of recourse?  TLDR: rats in house  owner says that's city life deal with it  Airbnb agrees what should I do?
4,RoverPetSitting,Two dogs I was walking got into a violent fight and I brought one to the vet-what happens now?,Hey guys. Not exactly sure what I am asking here but I am just kind of shook by my walk yesterday.   I was walking two dogs belonging to one client. Out of nowhere  the larger one attacked the smaller one and just gripped onto its face with its jaws. It was so merciless and bloody. It would not let go  I thought the big one was going to kill the smaller one! Thankfully someone heard the scuffle and ran outside to help me drag them apart. I took the smaller dog to the vet while the owner drove in from out of town. Injuries on the little guy were not pretty but not immediately life threatening.   I am wondering if anyone has ran into anything like this before? I called Rover right after the incident and they told me that I handled the situation perfectly. Then  in the follow up email they asked if I wanted to reimburse the client. I'm shocked!! I put myself in danger trying to get this unpredictably violent dog back into its home and then spent extra time driving the other one to the vet and waiting. I get that bringing it to the vet is part of the job and I empathize with the client because it's obviously terrifying getting a call Christmas night that your pets are injured. But  seriously  I was working on a holiday  I was scared for my safety and put extra time in  yet Rover wants me to reimburse them? Seems pretty whack to me.   Also  Rover did not seem concerned about the violent dog at all. Any idea if they will allow it back on the site? If so  is there any way I can warn other sitters/walkers? I did ask Rover support but they haven't gotten back to me.   Thanks for any thoughts you might have on the situation!
4,RoverPetSitting,Concerns &amp; Questions Before Joining Rover,I am considering applying for a dog-walking/sitting job through Rover or Wag (probably Rover) for a bit of extra income  but I have a few questions &amp; concerns before doing so.   My last two jobs required me to care for and walk dogs regularly  but I would in no way say that I have “professional” dog experience akin to people that have worked at vets or dog training schools  etc. But I do have experience with walking and dog-sitting for my current employer quite regularly  and with my experience nannying &amp; housekeeping  I am very trustworthy with people’s pets &amp; their personal belongings.   However  I do plan to get Red Cross certified for pet aid &amp; CPR  which I know will look good on a dog-walker profile. I also volunteer at Best Friends Animal Society but don’t have tons of experience with that yet either.   I am also a bit nervous about the possibility of walking large  hyper dogs with behavioral issues. For those that do dog-walking for various people  is this something you encounter regularly? My biggest fear is dealing with a dog that behaves aggressively around strangers or other dogs.   Do you think my lack of experience thus far will prevent me from getting consistent clients?  Should I wait until I have more experience with the animal shelter/wait to get CPR certified before applying for a dog-walking job?   I’m considering advertising my services on Craigslist or Facebook before attempting Rover  just to get a bit more experience.
5,mturk,P9R 'False Positive Rejections' / Rejecting HITs due to their own negligence and Request errors? Should we crowdsource evidence of this happening and work on building a Class Action Lawsuit?,"[sorry for posting this from a throwaway but because it might be a controversial opinion and possible beginnings of a class action lawsuit against p9r  a multi-million data corporation  I am taking anonymity precautions.]  So  my wife got into Turking recently. She does a fair bit of data entry at her job and while she was doing batch transcription requests she noticed she received rejections from some p9r HITs that she was 100% sure  were submitted without error.   I feel like was also burned in the beginning of my own Turking career by p9r  with what I felt were wrong/""false positive"" rejections. So I linked her the r/mturk threads which talk about various instances of p9r supposedly screwing over Turkers and why p9r request should be avoided if you care about your HIT approval rate. Instead  she decided to do a little experiment/investigation.  My lovely wife is a pretty vindictive and vengeful person when she feels like she is slighted. I guess you could say that she values honor/justice and she absolutely hates being conned and suckered. So she had the idea to Screen Capture herself filling out p9r requests and review the recorded footage of said rejections.   Out of 200 p9r transcription requests  15 of them were ""rejected"".   Upon the two of us reviewing of her screen capture footage of these rejections: all 15 of her rejected HITs were verified by us to be incorrect by p9r  with submissions containing ""illegible"" and ""blank"" as answers comprising the 11 of the 15 rejections.  The remaining 4 rejections were correctly filled out transcriptions of handwriting that was either somewhat messy or written in big letters and some portion of the word or name being missing from the sample picture.  From her test with a sample size of 1  it seems that p9r requests seem to have a 7.5%-out-100% ""incorrect rejection"" / ""false rejection"" rate on transcription requests.  Now I understand this is anecdotal evidence  so that's why I'm throwing this out there as an idea: let's crowdsource and organize data on p9r's HIT rejection rates as dedicated project.   Project participants Screenshot or ""Screen Capture"" Video Record p9r's Transcription HITs and we match up and review each of them.   We'll verify that the p9r HIT(s) were rejected incorrectly and contact p9r for each of them.   If there is no response to the reject appeals  we'll tally them up as evidence. Perhaps eventually use this data to organize a class action lawsuit against p9r for harming user's Mturk reputations/statistics and ultimately damaging Mturk as a platform with their own irresponsibility.  Maybe it'll make requesters think twice about harming users for their own mistakes or it could spur amazon into creating a better rejection appeal system for Mturk workers.   I'm throwing this out there as an idea on her behalf.  Any thoughts?"

5,vipkid,Help - I received a 1 Apple review with No comments and only 1 tag - any advice on how to fight this?, Pretty shocked by this one. I have over 500 5 Apple feedbacks  and a 5.0 rating.  I received a 1 Apple rating  no comments  just a ‘patience issue’ tag.   The student is a regular. 20 classes over the past few months. There have been weeks in a row when I am his only teacher  thought it seems he has other regular teachers. Never received a single feedback before.   The lesson was a UA class L2 Lesson 6 review/assessment class. I gave him a perfect score and gave him a glowing review. Haven’t re-watched the whole lesson in its entirety  but I couldn’t see anything obvious that deserved the tag. If anything  I might have looked bored or disinterested at times  but not impatient (he’s good at assessments but not very expressive).   Should I:   A) Request a review. A bit tough here to objectively prove the tag is wrong. Without specific details  there’s really no way to defend myself besides “I was patient throughout the class.” It will be totally up to the reviewers subjective opinion.   Or  B) Reply to the feedback. Something like  “Thanks for your feedback. However  without any details  I can’t improve my teaching. From what I can see on the replay  Baobao had an excellent assessment and had ample opportunities to speak throughout the class. Could you please be more precise with your feedback? I only want to provide my students with a 5 Apple experience....(or some BS reply like that)   Or both  and if so  in which order?   Thanks for all your help. Praise Dino.
5,Etsy,Action Required by Dispute Resolution  How to Respond?,Today  I woke up to the email header:  “Action required: Inquiry regarding your recent Etsy purchase” Describing a simple mixup with payment information on a purchase months ago that has long-since been resolved (I do not think the details are particularly relevant  so I am not going to describe them here). The email asks for a response  stating that ‘Failure to respond to this inquiry in 24 hours may result in the suspension of your account‘.  So I reply to the email stating how this has already been resolved  and am hit with the typical “This is not a monitored inbox. Visit the Help Center for support.” I visit the help center to find nothing pertaining to my situation  and I do not have any open cases on my account or any flags on the specific purchase.  From my perspective  I’ve just been issued a request for action without any actual channel to submit action. I apologize if I am just being dense  but am I missing something here? I’ve never had this happen before  and am hoping to not have my account suspended over something that has literally already been resolved. Without any case number  link  or direction other than “Go to Help Support ” how or where am I supposed to “respond to this inquiry within 24 hours”?  Any input is appreciated. Thanks.

5,mturk,Rejection from Consumer Behavior Researcher (An engaging consumer study about a meditation application) overturned,Just wanted to provide an update on a rejection that many of us received in regards to the title of this post:  I initially sent the requester a message several days ago inquiring as to what was the specific reason that my HIT was rejected. I received the same generic feedback response as many of you had.  After several days of no response  (and several intoxicating beverages tonight) I sent the requester another message basically saying that there were numerous workers all talking about their unfair rejections on this forum and that they should reverse my rejection immediately. About 1 hour after sending that email I noticed that the rejection was reversed. No response from the requester either.   Did anybody else have any luck getting this unfair rejection reversed?
5,Upwork,Can't join Upwork,"So basically what the title says. Here is the problem:  I have created an account  but entered my email adress with a typo. Everytime i log in  it redire ts me to verification page  where i should verify my email. Because i have entered a wrong email  i am clicking the ""change email"" button and enter the correct one. After pressing ""update and resend"" i always get this error:  *This almost never happes  but something went wrong. Please try again later or contact support for assistance.*  Now to get assistance from support i need to be logged in  but anytime i log in i am redirected to verification page  So i am stuck in this cycle now.  Could someone assist me here maybe  or can share some thoughts on how to go through this?  I don't want to create a new account  as i have used my brand name for the login."
5,mturk,Issues Joining,"So  I really want to join MTurk  and I have tried to do so twice now. I love micro jobs. Both times  my account gets approved  but then I have to make an Amazon Payments account. I first made an Amazon Payments account unconnected to my Amazon  and the response was that my identity information can't be confirmed. Then  I made another MTurk and Payments account connected to my Amazon account that has purchase history. Again I get an email saying my identity information can't be verified. I email the contact info and ask why  but all they said again was "" We have been unable to verify the information that you provided for your account. This information is required to use our service.""      Does anyone have advice on this issue? Should I call them or is that a waste of time? I'm tempted to give up. Thanks for the help!"
5,doordash,Adverse Action Notice for Dasher Application?,I submitted an application to be a dasher but they sent an adverse action notice regarding a ticket I received.  I gave an explanation in the email 5-6 days after Checkr sent the notification as to how it pertained solely to speeding and the officer gave me said ticket to save me money. A DoorDash autoemail got sent back to me saying they’re gonna take it into consideration.  After the 10 day deadline after my first application the company sends me another email saying they “received no initial information” after their first notice.   This is literally not the case and I’m so frustrated that I haven’t gotten in touch with a single human being regarding all of this. It could literally be put so simply if I could speak to some representative. I’m wondering if DoorDash has actually taken a look at the email I sent before sending a rejection letter.
