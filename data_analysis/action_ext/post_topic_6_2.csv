Hosts were not given notice of this change   most hosts were working out solutions with their guests. We were in shock when Air BnB stepped in and refunded guests 100% of their booking stay at the expense of the host. I am grateful for all Air BnB has done to help us book our properties. As the years  passed   Air BnB got bigger  working with customer service has been challenging  but we made the best of it. Their latest move of refunding our guests has just about put us out of business. Nobody knew the pandemic was coming  these are hard times for everyone  but why is 100% of the burden put on the hosts? guests have the option of purchasing travel insurance  hosts do not. I found an attorney who is getting ready to begin a class action suit. There is no guarantee that we will win  but the attorney feels if 10 000 hosts join  they will most likely settle.

We arrived Christmas Eve to a quaint first level apartment home. We noticed a few things that were off putting  but nothing that was a get me the hell out of here moment: paint chips on the ground through multiple floors  personal belongings in the entryway  unemptied trash  and just small signs of an unkempt home. Only things that you wish were different  but on Christmas Eve at 10 PM don't want to bother the owner about.   We are out of the house for a few days visiting family  and on the third day we come home to some visitors. One rat scurrying across the floor  holding a dead comrade in his mouth. Thats when we started noticing something was off. We went into the kitchen  the food we had there was torn apart and eaten. Through that night we heard the common sounds of rodents in the walls through all three floors of the property.  The next day we find a dead rat out on the back patio and I contact the owner for a refund due to he living conditions. I mentioned that the last tenant made a comment about a similarly dead rodent on the back porch a month prior and with the level of decay it's safe to say it's the same dead rat that's been around all month.  Couple the dead rats with the buckling hard wood floors  large bags of rat poison hanging on exposed pipes  and the unkempt nature of the place  I'm guessing the renter would be understanding and offer compensation. They offered 50% off one night as long as I did not give a bad review. I contact Airbnb and they are not able to hold the renter accountable.  Fast forward to today and nothing has been done to give compensation for the issue. What is my path of recourse?  TLDR: rats in house  owner says that's city life deal with it  Airbnb agrees what should I do?,1,7,jemappellepizza,2019-01-29 22:45:06

It is a condominium complex with parking facing the street. The first week I was here  someone stole the license plates off of my vehicle. It cost me approximately $150 to replace bc they were coming from another state and I needed them shipped via FedEx to my front door. The third week I was here  someone broke the window of my vehicle  which also cost me quite a bit to repair. Finally  last night  someone rear ended my car causing a lot of damage. I believe it was another person in the complex who parked next to my car. They are quite often drunk and their car has a ton of damage. I didn’t realize the damage to my car until I arrived at a second location. When I returned to the Airbnb  I noticed the car I suspected had left so I couldn’t get their license plate or compare damages.   I have not yet notified my host of last night’s incidents  but she was not very helpful with the prior two. Is there any way I can be reimbursed for the multiple damages or will I just have to swallow the costs? It is in a high-crime city and the police do not care about incidents such as these.

You can set up a single blackout date  and then if someone who has booked wants to extend  the dates look available yet won't go through to the cart. At this point he calls people and says you have to engage in a transaction off the platform because of a glitch. we were stupid to do business with him and not figure out that this is someone who found the flaws in the platform and leverages them. I'm sure we will be dealing with this guy in court for the next several months to come  and he is probably why Massachusetts has enacted laws to begin regulation in July. Is this something that Airbnb just figures into its business plan  the way that Amazon assumes that a certain percentage of packages will be stolen and have to be replaced?

2.0,0.3254,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",AirBnB,Fugitive Felon guest and airbnb said they would take no action,"This is my first post. Figured like this issue would merit kicking off from lurking to posting.   So  first off  I am not comfortable with this guest - he’s tried to bend or explicitly broken each of the few firm rules I have (quiet hours  smoking  use of oven)  and coupled with the rest of this post  I’d be inclined to cancel his stay  but he’s already checked in  knows where I live  etc.    Now that that’s out of the way: the guest in question  prior to check-in  asked a slew of questions in separate messages that started triggering my suspicions. He’s also stayed at airbnbs in my town off and on for a couple months  but his home location is across the country - not a flag in and of itself  necessarily. I have instant book on  so I can see his ratings and he has a pretty low rating for “observance of rules.” The combination of these was enough to trigger an informal background check on my part  which revealed multiple arrests for assault  resisting arrest  and check fraud among others. But the real kicker is the guy has outstanding felony warrants tied to a particularly heinous set of assaults in his home state and the subsequent failure to appear. So  the guy skipped town  bailed across the country to avoid his trial/hearing/what have you.   He was arrested in my town for these warrants  and as I understand it  the arresting jurisdiction can only hold an individual for 30 days for an extradition hearing  so today  at 33 days after his arrest  I assume the jurisdiction with the warrants didn’t respond or didn’t have/want to use the resources to ship this guy across the country.   I called airbnb figuring they may want to know. I assume the warrants are still valid  regardless of the lack of extradition (could be wrong - not an expert). Airbnb didn’t care - said their sign-up screening would catch would catch open felony warrants  so by their estimation the warrants must have been resolved. However  this guy signed up for and used airbnb in my town after these warrants were issued and prior to his arrest on these warrant in my town. Police in my town evidently found it worthwhile to track this guy down and arrest him for extradition  but airbnb’s screening missed it and today  just a over a month after his arrest  aribnb gave me a grand “meh - nothing we can do unless he made you feel unsafe and you wish to cancel.” Heck  even my casual searching pulled all this up in a matter of minutes.  There're really 2 issues  then:  1. Airbnb is presently turning a blind eye to a fugitive felon using their service. Could be wrong on this one since I don't know the outcome of extradition hearing or current status of the warrants. 2. Airbnb's ""background check"" missed the felony warrants for this guy  which is a major fail.    Meanwhile  I have 15 more hours with this guy flaunting my rules and the stress of having known what he did to other (again - I feel safe - these assaults were all domestic and I can handle myself).",3,11,Chestertonius,2019-05-21 02:01:31

TL:DR Guest booked without realizing it was a private room and not a whole house. I told her before she arrived what she was booking and the guest decided to stay. Guest arrived early (noon)  stayed the night  left at 9;00 AM. Two weeks later she is asking for a refund because she didn’t stay. AirBNB called  I showed them the messages which clearly indicate she stayed the night (she messaged about how to get in when they arrived and messaged the next morning to tell me that she was leaving and left the key). AirBNB said they would close the case with no refund.   Until this evening  I am a little perplexes as to why my payout came up short and bomb into one of tonight’s payout details to find the lady was issued a complete refund because she provided “proof” she didn’t stay here  except  she did.    Resolution specialist is reviewing the issue with his Supervisor and said they may need to contact the guest again and will call me back tomorrow but could offer no explanation for why they tried to pass the refund without updating me at all on the situation.

Should I take any action?,"TL;DR See title  I booked a condo 6 months ago. About two months ago  he messaged me that he'd sold the property and could either give us a refund or transfer us to another place. As we didn't suspect anything weird at that point  we chose to stay with the host at another of his properties. We completed the transfer via Airbnb methods.  Cue vacation time. I start messaging him a week ahead to see about early check-in based on flight times  etc. His responses are very slow. I realize now that he'd completely checked out  but at the time  it just seemed like horrible communication.  We arrive (ultimately not early  flight was delayed)  and we have several questions about check in  overnight parking  etc. All of which he either ignored or responded to minimally after much pestering.  We wake up the second day of our trip  and find folks in our patio area. Not out of the ordinary  as the building holds two units. But as we're walking through  a man says  ""are you staying in the upstairs unit?"" Me: ""yeah...""  And he proceeds to introduce himself as the new owner. He told me he'd closed the previous evening  and the prior owner made no mention that we'd be here. Of course  we didn't know anything either. The new owner was incredibly apologetic that we've all been put in this situation  and asked if we had a few minutes sometime this weekend to allow them to inventory things.  So we've spent the last day or so chatting with these folks as we are coming and going. They just spent about 30 mins in our unit inventoring things  and plan to drop off some stuff that we're missing. We also have their number now so we can call with any issues. They also informed us that we have a garage that can be used  which would have been nice to know from the get go  as we've been using public parking. They seem just as irritated that we are that neither of us were informed of the others existence. Also  as part of this  they pointed out that we have no fire extinguisher  and will be bringing one tomorrow.  At this point  should I be taking any action through airbnb? I made my final payment to the previous guy a few weeks ago  and it sounds like the new owners will be fighting him for most of my money  as they own the place for 7 of my 8 nights.

We are trying to niche on business-class visitors and those coming to specific events (cons  marathons  concerts  etc) so from the beginning we asked were they were heading  no specific answer provided - they don't have to answer  we know  yet...  So they arrive  we show the house and still asking were they are heading  first they say they're going to the historic center  then asking for a Walmart  them saying they're going to stay and wait firm some friends.  30 minutes later  that girl that showed like a decent young lady just throw away all her glamour is vigorously trying to clean her nose for a solid 10 minutes  she left the door open so we can get the guy opening cans. Did I mention they entered with a carton box instead of luggage?  I passed by the room on my way to check my boy and a deep beer smell is coming from their room. We call the girl outside and let her know the rules are no alcoholic beverages allowed  we tell her she lied about coming from Spain and you know what did she said? She just lost her phone so had to make a new profile... Yeah... She lost the phone  and didn't know the account stays there  and created an improvised. RLY?  By then my boy was with a neighborhood while we were waiting for them to leave  the guy comes down stumbling and the lady looking down in shame without saying a word  they just packed their things and leave.

Good first night.  Second night less so. Was out all day  got back at 9pm to find the front door deadbolt lock was removed.  The host apparently wanted to replace it with a keypad lock but didn't realize the door was metal and had trouble drilling holes into the door  so left the lock removed.  Called a ""technician"" and they'll come out tomorrow.  Right now there's no lock on the main door  just a lockable glass screen door that can of course be broken and entered through.  Back door is always unlocked says the host.  Luckily my private room does have a lock  but still.  I went for a walk and upon returning  the host commented on my pot belly (I had a mini pot  I'm not overweight for my height but am skinny fat.   She said walking is good  but diet is more important (she's right).  She showed me a bunch of products from what looked like an Amway type company and sure enough  it's a lesser known MLM (multi level marketing) company.  She was trying to sell me the idea of joining and buying products  claiming discounts on product purchases if I joined  them being organic  science based  proven for years  etc.    When she left the room briefly I looked up their web site and it's typical MLM   with high product prices  knowing that people higher ranked than her get a cut of the profits.   I'm wondering how I should handle this situation.  Not completely comfortable with the unsecured front and rear doors  but even less so about her comment about my body shape and worse  getting a sales spiel pushed in my face  even until 11:46pm when I finally told her I have an appointment tomorrow morning  I have to go to bed.

Wanted to get out of their booking (I'm pretty sure because they were looking for an apartment in town and found one) but they were bound by my cancellation policy. They did some weird crap to try  but in the end I said that if they left  I would just give them whatever nights were rebooked by other guests.   They said they wanted to stay a couple more days  I said cool  just call Airbnb and have they cancel the listing from then on so we can open those dates and hopefully I can get someone else in there. They instead just cancelled their whole booking. Stopped responding to messages  and then left the next morning to my protest. Airbnb also apparently tried to contact them but they wouldn't pick up. I was away at work and couldn't come home. They left the next morning  this is all documented in our messages.   They then left a review.

I've been a Superhost for awhile  and rent the house full time  with a 4.9 rating over 114 reviews. I honestly never check my booking rate  and only pay attention when I see vacancy -- it's extremely rare to have vacancy Th-Sat  and busier months are usually full midweek  as well. Just to level set  Airbnb says my booking rate is usually between 1.6 - 2.2%  with a little variance on off months. Here are my concerns:     1. I haven't received the final report  but I'm apparently in line for $5k-10k of ""improvements"" to the property to qualify for Plus. You have to spend money to make money  but this is no longer my home  it's a hotel I run  so I derive no value from this new furniture... 2. ...so I'll need to raise my rates significantly and make the money back over time. Will this ROI work? If I'm already booked near capacity  will that many people pay  say  22% more to stay in my Plus listing? Or will I price myself out of guests? 3. ...and will I be able to also outpace Airbnb's increased booking fees (I believe from 3%-6%)?     If it costs me money to get started  but I get as many guests  who are ""higher quality"" and who pay more  I totally consider that a win.

The couple brought 2 small dogs which they've let roam around the yard  barking  and terrorizing anyone who comes near. Eventually  one of the dogs came at my dog and I told the man that my dog isn't friendly with others  which he ignored.   A couple days later  after discussing it with the host  I sent the daughter a message requesting her to ask her parents to please keep their dogs on a leash  that although I'm sure the dogs are well behaved  we have 3 other dogs on the property and I wanted to avoid any unneeded conflicts. She said  sure  no problem. That was a few days ago.  Last night  my husband answers a phone call on our balcony  and comes back inside.

I look out the window and it's the guest screaming at our window  ""You got something to say to me?!?"" and hitting our metal staircase.

He told me I was a mean person for mentioning the dogs to his daughter  that I gave her a bad review (he thought the message was a review I guess  had the explain to him that's not how it works)  that I use the shared laundry room too much  that I get too many deliveries  and I'm not a nice neighbor for just coming to him about the dogs. I explained everything I do is in writing for reasons like this and I would not now or ever knock on his door to inform him of the rules.   He was also upset that the other tenants on the property weren't socializing out in the yard with him and he brought a BBQ looking forward to hanging out with people. We never hang out in the yard  we are working people in our 30s with things to do  this isn't Melrose Place. Just completely delusional and weird. The list of complaints went on.   After he told me that he lives on the property and I explained that he is only a guest here  I realized he had no clue that there are rules and his daughter never bothered to tell him that. Besides being clueless   he's an entitled asshole who expects way more than a $50/night Airbnb offers. I got him to calm down  but he called the host who could not care less. He then proceeded to spend the rest of the evening trying to rally my neighbors against me. Laughable.  If it were up to me  I'd make him leave for threatening violence. But the host doesn't want to do that  says he's only got a week left. So  I guess my question is how am I supposed to handle this when review time comes around? Do I leave a bad review on his daughter's profile even though she never stayed here? And can she review us although she was never here? I'm guessing yes  she can. Is this something I might have to contact Airbnb about.  By the way  this is absolutely the last time I'm allowing anyone to book on behalf of someone else. I've already discussed this with the host.",1,21,scorpio_siren,2020-02-27 23:51:39

I am on mobile.   I received a message from a host recently that demanded half of the full refund that I got from Airbnb due to my stay occurring within the original specified timeframe for refunds (March 16-31  I believe). He has stated that if I do not pay him  he will be suing me personally for breaching the rental agreement  which he claims Airbnb has no involvement in. The overall basis of his claim is that he did not accept Airbnb’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy that made COVID-19 such a circumstance.   I have read through Airbnb’s policies and have found that the Extenuating Circumstances Policy supersedes a Host’s personal cancellation policy  and that epidemics are listed as a special review circumstance (i.e.  Airbnb will review the situation to determine if the epidemic at the time warrants being made part of the Policy). Through continued use of the platform  such as messaging Guests with these payment demands  accepts the new policy. Even if such an action didn’t work  the Extenuating Circumstances Policy clearly lists epidemics as events that may warrant refunds should Airbnb determine they do qualify.   I am wondering if anyone else has received or heard of a message like this. If so  what are your thoughts?,1,14,acciohermoninny,2020-04-05 12:50:28

Things are looking grim here  I am probably going to have to sue Airbnb. My host had some shady cancellation policy. I cancelled a week prior once my events and reasoning for going to california were all cancelled due to covid. Airbnb ofcourse delayed response on the topic. Weeks ago  they initially told me on call that I would be recieving a refund due to my dates falling in line with the announced full refund policy (Starting March 14th).   Today  I still have not recieved a refund and they actually closed my old support thing. The new support thing is requiring travel restrictions and what not which ofcourse were not put in place due to the pandemic still being early at the time. This is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL.

From NPR  ""Updated April 10 at 6:20 p.m. ET  The changes have come on an incredible scale.  Within just a handful of weeks  states across the country have enacted a range of sweeping regulations with massive consequences for residents — from the closure of physical school buildings to outright statewide stay-at-home orders. And all with one goal in mind: to somehow slow the wildfire-like spread of the coronavirus.  The disruptions to daily life are now stacking up at such a fast pace  it can be difficult to keep them all straight.

A guest trashed one  admitted fault  refused to pay damages that exceeded the security deposit  refused to pay the final electric bill  called my friend a clown and a joke  then moved next door and told him to sue if he didn’t like it.,This guy left cigarette butts and ashes all over the bedroom  burned holes in the high end mattress and sheets (also a blood stain on the mattress from his girlfriend)  didn’t pay the final electric bill and so on. The lease specifically states that smoking is not allowed inside and it is also a health code violation in our country. His entire stay was peachy until he checked out and my friend went to inspect the property and walked into a disaster zone. When confronted by text and in person the guest said that he paid a security deposit so he couldn’t be charged anything beyond that amount which is obviously untrue. The conversation was short and ended with him laughing and saying “sue me”. So we did as I have a lawyer on retainer for my company. I suppose he assumed that since the lawyer and court fees would (usually) cost significantly more than the damages he would be in the clear.   Long story short  he shit his pants (probably on someone else’s mattress) when he received a court summons for next month. Basically what that means is if he left the country with an open case my friend would get an automatic judgement against him and if he returned to Thailand in the next 10 years he would be detained. Since the lawyer fee cost about the same as the damages (big discount)  he had to pay twice as much as he initially owed to avoid going to court - about 3000 USD after deducting the security deposit and discounting the damaged items to account for depreciation. In his opinion  my friend “bullied” him.   He will be leaving as soon as the airports open. We expect that he will post an extremely negative and biased review as soon as he returns to his home country. My friend only has 5 star reviews and has never had to deal with a situation like this. We have all of the photos  multiple admissions of guilt  a plethora of very rude responses to my friend and our lawyer before he changed his tune  and a signed copy of the settlement agreement... everything that shows that this guest was entirely in the wrong.   If/when he posts his review how should my friend respond? Is there anything he can do preemptively? My friend didn’t want to sue this guy but he literally asked for it and it was the only way to get the damages covered.,2,48,islandfool,2020-05-29 17:01:00

During the second month my landlord showed up at my apartment unannounced and went into the property without permission.  Luckily  I wasn't there as he would of been seen as an intruder.  The Landlord had left his flashlight within my personal belongings and I'm missing items of large value.  When I confronted the landlord and suggested his actions were not wise  he threatened me and illegally told me to leave the premises.  I did not file a criminal report but may now.    AirBnB promised a refund for my unspent amount and AirBnB was rather receptive.  Then COVID hit  and this became a shit show.  I've been trying to contact AirBnB for over 4 months now.  They respond that they need to escalate my ticket  but then I hear nothing from them.  I've since disputed the transaction.  AirBnB had fought me on it  and it took 3 months to get my decision which was in my favor.  I withdrew the money and closed that credit card.  AirBnB had still not returned or responded any of my enquirers.  The entire process has cost me around 16-24 hours.  Turns out  AirBnB just sent a NEW charge to my closed account for the month in question.  The Credit Card account is closed  but it now shows its entirety on my statement.  I've disputed it again  and tried to contact AirBnB  but only get the same ""we've escalated message"".  I tried to tell the person who redirected me that I've contacted them many times before and they keep escalating it then not responding.  They now are no longer responding and I've heard nothing from them (again).  I'm currently looking for a Lawyer and am contemplating a civil action law suit for damages sustained due to their ridiculousness and inability to meet what they said they would do in writing.  I'm also going to look for compensation for the time spent and lost items.  I'm now stuck with MORE work trying to clear this from my credit card and am afraid it will hit my credit.

I feel fairly strongly that their leadership need to hear this; if you agree  does anyone have any suggestion of the best way to get it to them?  ----  Hi   As are many  I’m of two minds given the past two blog posts.  All the communications read like someone *trying to write what people want to hear.* No matter how talented a writer you are  authenticity somehow can’t be faked.   ""The COVID-19 global pandemic is severely impacting *your beloved Couchsurfing community*."" Whoever’s writing these posts might be 100% as well-intentioned as they claim  but I simply can’t believe that Couchsurfing is their community – it’s their job.  Couchsurfing is a table with three legs: without any one of them  it can’t stand. Money  technology  community. You need them all.  ----  You – or your predecessors – have lost the trust of your user base. This isn’t a problem that can be solved by writing better blog posts. ""Going forward  we will work on a process together with the Couchsurfing Ambassadors on *how we should communicate changes*.” Nah... that’s not going to cut it.  This is an “actions speak louder than words” moment: you can only win back trust with *meaningful structural changes*. The company and its community are estranged entities. You need to unite  or perish.  Community Ambassadors should be more than communications advisors: they should be members of the decision-making board.  ----  You said: “We have made a conscious effort to keep the focus on the Couchsurfing community.” What if  instead  you could say “the Couchsurfing community has been an integral part of our decision-making process”?  You said that “the community had remained the priority instead of making money.” What if you could instead say: “Together  our community leaders  operations and finance team  and engineers have been hard at work threading the needle  striking the (sometimes difficult) balance between competing needs  in order to keep us both a viable organization and a valuable community”?  You said: “We hear you.” But who even are you? What if  instead of signing off as a nameless  faceless “Sincerely  The Couchsurfing Team ” you were represented by actual couchsurfers?  ----  What if you could send out an email written in the first person  signed with a name and a face and a profile – an ambassador with a reputation in the community  glowing reviews on their profile  and a meaningful position in the company?  That’s what I need to see in order to financially contribute: not more transparency into the company as it is  but **a reform of the organization** which brings back the third leg of the table.  Unless I see that  I won’t give my money to a lost cause.  That being said  I hope to send you financial support soon!

We're hoping to do it again on June 19th as a big event through our student group - the aim is to 'hitchhike' to as many countries as possible by getting people to join our teams' video calls. It'll be an opportunity to speak to other people across the world and have a bit of a cultural exchange in these mad times where we unfortunately cannot travel further than our computer screens. Our students will all be donating money to take part so it's all for some great causes.

The goal was for him to get back to previous level of physical ability regarding walking. They are getting ready to discharge him  I think because he’s hitting the 21 day mark where Medicare stops paying 100%.  I don’t feel that’s he’s ready for discharge. He’s receiving all food and medicine through injections or a gtube.  He would probably not get all doses if left only to homecare where he argues with everyone. And he can walk with a walker but can’t actually get himself up and down from bed/chair without support.  Are there any points I can bring up with the SNF to advocate for him staying longer?

The problem lies that we have a 3yo and 5yo together and she can barely take care of herself most the time  let alone the kids. I keep trying to fix the marriage but she insist we are done there is nothing to save  and leave her alone. I packed up all my stuff yesterday and was going to leave and then she was like  no   I’ll go I can’t take care of the kids anyway. So first and foremost I would never kick out the mother of my children  especially with her health circumstances. At the same time  I was almost happy to leave and shed this caregiver role. I know there will be no winners but I don’t know how to make a break with honor. We moved close to her sister  but she has a dying child and belittles my wife’s disease as non serious. Her mother is too narcissistic  she is constantly making up symptoms to compete and would never take care of her like a mother if I left. Then there is my kiddos. How could I not be the one to get them up every day and see their beautiful faces. I have no idea what to do besides to retreat to the couch.

My wife was making dinner and was almost done. I sat down with our 1 year old boy and started talking to her about her day. I asked her a few questions like: how was your day? Did you go to your doctor's appointment? (No). Which doctor did you not go to? Did our child take a second nap?   Context: my wife was on her ""off day"" where we have a nanny for 6 hours of the day so she'd been home for about 2 hours.   Click  things started to turn. She was now being negative. I asked if there was anything I could help with. Enter more negativity from her. Then she blew up on me. I said : oooookkk in a snarky manner. She got madder and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and I was forced to care for our child and put him in bed.   We finished our fight: she said I am always negative and snarky and dont take her serious. I said: my bad  sorry I did that. I didn't mean to but would like to stop fighting so we can have a nice start to a long weekend.   She went to bed and we didn't talk again.  My questions are:  1. Is this her depression/anxiety talking? 2. Am I really that narcissistic that I think I did nothing wrong? 3. Can I do something to prevent this or am I doomed to occasional random fights without resolution because of her depression/anxiety?

Now I just wait for her to make a difficult demand that I take time off work for each week.   To those who say: she needs help and medicine. Yes she does. She's on the best medication she's had to date. She still refuses extra counseling  but to be fair to her - she's tried it many times without success.  I'm tired. I'm scared of our financial future.

I'm watching twin 2.5 NKs this week while parents are out of town and I just fought one of them to nap for almost an hour. Her mom lays with her to get her to sleep (ugh) but mom and I have always had different things we do when putting them down for bed and it's never been a problem. However  they've recently moved out of cribs  which complicates matters because now she can get out of bed. Anyways  for the last 4 days  I've gotten her to sleep with minimal fighting it (we sing two songs and then I lay with her for two minutes and then get up - sometimes she's sleeping  sometimes still awake - and if she's awake  I tell her I'll check on her but she always falls asleep right away). But today  she fussed and cried when I walked away. I told her I'd check on her if she laid quietly. And she did so I sang a song and she fell asleep. But then she woke up right after I left and she cried again so I reminded her I only check on quiet kids so she was quiet. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes until she was no longer able to stay quiet and was sobbing for mom. So to salvage her and her sister's nap  I sat next to her until she fell deeply asleep. All told  it took me an hour and I was CRANKY by the end of it. (It doesn't help that she woke me up 5 times last night with this kind of shit). Anyways. They've always been such good sleepers and I've never had this much trouble getting kids to nap. Should I have just called it quits or laid with her earlier? Ugh. I'm just so frustrated with this whole week (they sleep way worse now that they'te in big kid beds so I'm tired and annoyed that parents essentially waited for me to be here this week to transition them to big kid beds).,1,6,ariel6753,2019-01-06 22:21:33

We have no problem with her relaxing and watching TV while the kids are napping  but she does this even while they are awake. I should add she has no additional cleaning or errand duties.

I'm in a pretty awful situation regarding a sick family member who has been recently put in hospice care. It's definitely taking a huge toll on me and my ability to focus and be patient. My MB is aware of the situation and has been so great. But I can't afford to take any time off right now and even though MB has a super flexible schedule she obviously still needs to work. But I'm at a point where I'm kind of just waiting each day for that phone call. So in turn I'm having a hard time planning or even just handling things with my NKs. I'm still trying to keep a somewhat solid schedule and have some activities ready (Books  puzzles  coloring  and thankfully 2f and 4f play pretty well together) but it's still to cold to take them outside for too long. I've also been told by MB that if I need to throw on a movie or something I can but I don't want to just plop them in front of the TV all day everyday.

Since Spring break two weeks ago  he’s started jumping on his bed  pushing his stuffed animals behind his bed  playing with his blanket  kicking the walls  etc at nap time. After taking everything out of his bed after 40+ min of this  he just rolls around the bed for another 25-30 min until I decide to go in and pat his back. When this happens  he’s asleep almost instantly. He stays at school for nap some days  and comes home other days. Is he phasing out of naps  is he overtired and is getting his second wind? Like I said  he falls asleep immediately after I go in (after at least an hour) and before a couple of weeks ago  this was never an issue and he went to sleep quickly and without fuss.

I wasn’t going but I was going to house/dog/pool sit and I was excited about it lol. I got paid for the whole week anyway. Last night MB messaged me and told me a time to come over today because they were supposed to fly out today but they still needed my help getting the kids ready for the airport and everything. And at the very end she said “oh I might not be going  but I’ll keep you updated. See you tomorrow.” I was like “okay  I hope everything is alright  see you in the morning.”   When I got there this morning the vibe was very off. Everyone still smiles and greeted me and usual but MB and DB were not speaking or even looking at each other. They left in different vehicles to run errands and he left about 10 minutes before she did. She stayed behind and she was like “oh yeah  we’re fighting” and I was like “I hate to hear that.” She just kind of shrugged it off and told me she would be home by 11:30 to let me go.  Well 12:00 rolled around and I hadn’t heard anything from either of them. And then they both got home at 12:30  MB looked like she had been crying and DB was visibly upset and went straight to the bedroom. Then he came back and sat at the dining room table while I finished telling MB the last time everyone ate and stuff. I took it as my cue to leave and she told me they still didn’t know what they were doing but she would keep me updated.  The oldest kept asking if they were going to see Nana in Florida and DB just said “I don’t know buddy”.  Man it breaks my heart. I love this family and I hate to see them fighting. I don’t know what it’s over obviously  but I hate it. I’ve been with them for 10 months now and I consider myself pretty close to them and I just want to make sure they’re alright but I know I don’t want to overstep. But man  I’m sad.

I have two nanny kids. 4M and 1F. 1F has a very rough first year. She spent months in the NICU and while she has a positive outlook going forward  she will never be 100%  and we are still not sure what exactly her life will look like - the quality and length of it should be good  but we are still learning about the extent of her needs.  MB has gone above and beyond finding her the best (and extra therapies)  advocating for her  fundraising  getting second opinions - you name it  she’s probably done it. For 1F.  4M on the other hand... it’s like 1F has been so sick that 4M must be healthy. He’s so “brave” (like his sister  of course) and “understanding beyond his years” (about his sister  of course) and “has no adverse effects from their hospital stay” (besides crying every time there’s a transition and the stress induced stutter he’s developed).   She recently said to me “I feel like I missed out on all of 3” (the kids birthdays are super close together). And the fact is - she did. I attended all of the school parties. I took kiddo on his first roller coaster ride  his first zoo trip  last day of school and first day of summer camp  potty trained - you name it  I probably did it this year. And I know that in part I did all of that because MB and DB knew that 4M was in good hands with an adult who adores him.  But she recently posted online about all of the advocating she’s done for 1F and ended it by saying “fight like a mother!” And just - I have been advocating like crazy for 4M. He needs to see a speech therapist and a play therapist and needs to spend more quality time with his parents that doesn’t revolve around 1F and her diagnosis. And it has been slow and required me to push to get all of this done. It has gotten done though and 4M will hopefully benefit greatly from the services he is receiving.   Fight like a mother  for both of your kids.  End rant.  And I do feel awful for MB and DB and the situation they’re in and I would never want to be in their position and all of that. And I know MB has some mental health issues stemming from the 4 months baby girl spent in the NICU and all of the trauma that entailed. And MB knows exactly how I feel about her needing to spend quality time with 4M and they are genuinely trying  especially now that there is a clear medical plan in place for 1F. I just.

It would be amazing if Nanny could do it. But I don't know if it's an appropriate request since it's not actually childcare and there won't even be any children present. It is child *related* of course  but not childcare  so I thought I would ask. I would pay her for the whole day of course  and she can just leave when she's done with the project.

This family is quite the hot mess. Boundaries are fuzzy  consequences are subject to the convenience of NPs  and to top it off  after more failed grades than passing at school number 1  they moved 8F to a private school where she has been for less than a month now. A conference with NPs and the teacher confirmed what I had known all along- if situations at home remain the same there will be no change in 8F's grades or behavior regardless of what school  extracurriculars  or tutors she goes to. I am at my wits end here because I have spent so much time and effort in trying to get this message across. I have written pages of notes  requested countless meetings with both NPS (changing my schedule to fit theirs)  and lost so much sleep  for every paper to be put on a shelf and never read and every requested and confirmed meeting to be canceled at the last minute because of loads of stress or exhaustion they were feeling. Two years I have been going through this. Now I arrive at work and find a note left for me about the conference that was held and informing me that I need to work harder to improve 8fs confidence level and teach her to participate in school. What I would like to say to both NPs is as follows. ""Unfortunately as much as I so desire to help and despite every effort to do so  the biggest influence of confidence comes directly from the value you show to your child. How confident would you feel if your own parents so deliberately passed on every chance to spend time with you then to make it worse  would drop everything to attend any sports practice  art show  or trip to the toilet of your older sister's? How would you feel if your parents told the nanny that you had to go to bed early on a weekend but your older (by 1 year) sister was allowed to stay up until mom and dad got home? What about if they went on a vacation and took the older sister but said you couldn't go. What if they assured you they would be gone for 3 days but decided to stay for 10 instead? How confident would you be if you were lied to about the reason you had to switch schools even when you knew the real reason? Do you think you would value yourself as a person if the very people who should show you  unconditional love  actually led you to believe that you were not worthy of their time?""

4.0,0.4143,"time, week, hour, work, call, thing, minute, long, wait, put",Nanny,Struggling with transportation strike,Hi  I live in Paris where there's a huge transportation strike going on.  I work with a nanny agency and work for a family for 9h per week for 3 days meaning  3h per day. I also work for family directly based on need for extra hours.  - When the strike started agency said they won't modify our payroll and if we can't go we should make it up another day. So  I stayed over and didn't get extra pay a day before the strike.  - For today (Monday) MB told me that I don't need to come because DB couldn't get to work and he's at home with NK. She also kindly said that she would really appreciate if I could go on Tuesday. I said I'll try my best and let her know if I can't.   - Agency emailed me today saying that I should be ok with 45 minutes walk  and 1 hour 15 minutes commute. So  I shouldn't be cancelling under these conditions.  This email really made me angry for following reasons:  - 90 minutes walk / 2h30m transportation is not justifiable for 3h work. Unless they're willing to reimburse me for some of that time or pay my Uber they shouldn't be able to force me to do that. It feels to me like they're being entitled to my time and I would have gone through the trouble for a full time job but I don't think 3h work isn't really worth it.  - I would be totally fine with not getting paid for the session that I couldn't attend due to strike but they don't want to cancel these sessions (probably extra work load for payroll) and force us to go instead. It sounds like their problem. I get 10€ for every 30€ they make so them pushing me doesn't sit right with me  they're not my primary source of income.  - With that arrangement I have with family  for each missed session they pay to agency  I lose money on the extra hours I provide. I understand that it's my problem but again  I could be working a second job at Starbucks etc. Time = Money. It's not my fault that there's strike.  Long story short  I'm really annoyed and I'll reply to agency with these points in a more professional manner. In the meantime I'm considering several options such as;  1. Quit agency and work with the family directly. (Legally  on the books) 2. Quit the family and find a family that's at walking distance (plenty available in the area) 3. Don't say anything to anyone and just say you're unable to go during the strike.  Am I being unreasonable  overreacting?   PS: I can't ride a bike or take electric scooter (too expensive for the distance. And busses are unpredictable  they can just drop you mid-route randomly.

I’m not quite sure yet if I have found my partner in neurosis or a huge ticking time bomb of a job haha.

Anytime I redirect her if she does something not safe or not nice she screams at me and hits me or throws toys at me. I say over and over to use gentle hands and have her show me  which  she’ll do occasionally but the hitting still continues. Now she’s fighting meal times too and will scream the entire time she’s in her high chair and refuse to eat most every meal. She also hates getting her diaper changed and will kick and hit me while screaming the entire time. When I explain this to MB and DB they always chalk her behavior up to her teething but it’s literally everyday that she’s this way. WFH DB also always comes out of his office when she screams and tries to help  which is nice but  he often just picks her up when she’s throwing a tantrum or gives her her pacifier to keep her quiet. I used to love my job but now I’m just dreading coming in every day. I feel like it’s also impacting 3F because I can hardly spend time with her because little sister is out of control. I’m leaving in a month (unrelated to this issue  I got a teaching job) and I wanted to enjoy my time with the girls but this is the least I’ve enjoyed my job in the two years that I’ve been here. Asking for advice/ranting and wondering if all I’m doing to help her is even worth it at this point. Please help!!!,3,12,emily_bee_rey,2020-06-16 14:53:41

4.0,0.4932,"time, week, hour, work, call, thing, minute, long, wait, put",Nanny,Fight between two live-in Nannies.,This is going to be long. Hopefully some of you read this:)  I’m a live in Nanny. There are two of us. Let’s call the other Nanny  Blue. Blue has had problems with the previous Nanny. In fact I’ve had to ask Blue to stop talking about the other Nanny badly because it made me uncomfortable. I didn’t know the other nanny well and she seemed like such a sweet person when I was being interviewed  therefore I didn’t feel the need to hear the gossip. Wasn’t interested. That was a red flag for me.   Over the past few months I’d notice anything I’d share with Blue would be told to the Mom. For example  I had met a friend and I hung out with them a few times and then Blue asks me “did you move out here/get this job because of this person” I said no. I just met this person I wanted to start making friends. Next day Blue tells the Mom about this conversation. Mom just brings it up. Now I feel weird because I don’t want the Mom to think I moved out here for that. The list goes on  even little things like if I wanted to go the mall  Mom asks “I heard you were going to the mall”.  I’m a very private person. I just don’t appreciate people telling my business. Blue has already gotten in trouble for eavesdropping on the NK’s monitor and listening in on the parents conversations. She constantly barges into the room when I’m with 10moF and it is so annoying. She doesn’t have any boundaries.   Over the past few weeks I’ve had discussions with myself about my life and wondering if I would want to move back home. I shared these thoughts with Blue. (I know I let my guard down) I told her specifically that this was between us and I was thinking of moving back but I don’t have any plans. Not even a week ago I told her I’m going to stay and try and establish myself here. This is important **** I applied for a second job to meet friends+make more money. I got the job Thursday. I was so happy. Blue and and discussed how we need to switch shifts for about two days out of the week so I can go work. Blue works mornings  I work afternoon-evenings. So we would switch  I do mornings and she’d do evenings. We agreed to this. She even helped me pick out a interview outfit and was excited I got the job.  Mom comes in this morning and said so I have a question  are you leaving us? And I said what? Did Blue say something? She confirmed. I said I was loosely talking and if I had decided to leave I would give months in advance. But I don’t even have a concrete plan  absolutely nothing it’s just a thought. Even when the Mom and I were talking Blue barges in and the Mom asks her to leave. You can clearly hear talking from the hallway. Everything was so awkward and I felt so weird.   Anyways  Blue leaves the house after she’s asked to leave and I send her a text. To sum it up I respectfully told her how it wasn’t her place to share what I told her in confidentiality. I also mentioned that I fully competent to speak for myself and if I needed to I would have told the Mom myself. I told her after so many instances like this I don’t trust to have anything but a superficial conversation with her and ask if she keep anything else I told her  private.   She responded “Sorry you feel that way but I didn’t bring it up to Mom. If you want to set a boundary  fine you are coworker. So I feel like I’m not going to change my schedule. I will stick with mornings.”  I replied with this “Ok so I guess your comfortable with implying Mom was lying. And because I feel the need to call you out on your nosiness you want to sabotage my chance at the other job. This isn’t high school Blue  grow up.”   Blue: “You know I didn’t really care. You do what you want. If it doesn’t involves 10moF or something with the house. Then we don’t need to talk.”  Me: “oh most definitely”  I know this is really long and if you read/skimmed this far maybe you have an opinion? I know I could’ve come off more professionally but I was so sick of her sharing my business especially this instance because one: I told her not to tell anyone please  these are just thoughts. Two: I told her not even a week ago I had decided to stay.,1,14,bbghehe,2020-07-12 00:40:30

The mosquitos at their house are INSANE.    The problem is that the kids HATE putting on bug spray. They are 4  4  and 7. The minute I say we need to put on bug spray they throw a fit and eventually just say “well then I’m going inside” which isn’t the ideal move because we need outside time + one kid usually puts it on and then it’s not fair that we all have to go inside.     So far I’ve tried to make it fun: drive by bug spray! Everyone lines up  one goes through the drive thru and gets their legs done then back of the line. Next kid goes and then we keep going until everyone is completely covered.    Swing and spray! They sit on the swing and I stand in front of them. Every time they come forward  I spray a spot.     DIY— self explanatory  i let them do it themselves as long as they cover everything     Choices! Do you want me to spray big dots or do a line down your arm then you rub it in?     The most efficient way is letting them choose line or dot but sometimes they won’t even have that. Usually 1 out of the 3 will usually agree to bug spray but it always varies on who the 1 kid is. It’s so frustrating!!   Today I was fed up with the bug spray fight so I just walked up to them and sprayed them without telling/asking. This made them really upset and I did feel bad about it. I try to treat them the way I want to be treated and I wouldn’t like if someone snuck up on me and started spraying but gosh what else could I do?

This is not right...,"Last night I received an email from Amazon about not picking up an order.   It's the same one that many of us on here have received.    This is my first  and only my second 'bad' email in 8 months of doing this gig.   The first one was a customer complaint.   I am so frustrated and aggravated.  Anyhow  I replied to the email and I also sent an email directly to flex-support...  I asked for specifics and stated this has to be an error.   To my dismay I received the following reply this morning twice within 10 minutes of each other :   **As we wrote in our original message  this issue has occurred more than once in recent blocks. While we understand that issues happen occasionally  we expect these cases to be very rare. Remember to swipe ""acknowledge and begin"" every time you are prompted to do so -- that lets customers know you are on the way. After acknowledging  promptly collect the orders and ‘swipe to finish’ in the app to let customers know everything is picked up.**      **Regards **   **Amazon Flex Support**   &amp;#x200B;  First off my belief is that is just the standard answer to my email.   There is no way on earth I've had more than one of these instances 'in recent blocks'.   The ONLY situation I can think of recently was this:  Arrived  picked up 2 orders  drove towards 1st destination.  About a mile from my first stop  and about six miles from WF I get another stop added.     The app said I had up to a 40 minute window to pick up the extra order.  Because I was so close to the 1st order  and the 2nd order was 4-5 miles from the 1st  I went ahead and delivered my original 2.   If I would have turned right around I would have had to double-back to the first 2 orders and the new delivery was east of the store and not near the first two....  While I was en-route back to WF's the 3rd order fell out of my itinerary.   This happens from time-to-time and it just got reassigned.   I made it back to WF's and was immediately given a different order.   I took it.  End of story....  Can someone tell me if indeed that was the 'missed order'  what the hell I did wrong and how did I break any rules?   Doesn't the TOS say I can take orders in any order as long as they are on time?   If that 1st customer was watching me come to them and I would have turned right around  wouldn't that look bad along with have both of my original orders in my vehicle 30+ minutes longer than they had to be?  I am so upset at this situation.   I've \*NEVER\* not gone back to pick up an order.   I've been doing this full-time for the last 6+ months.   It's so frustrating to have situations like this since you are never given a straight answer or given any opportunity to speak to a real human.  Amazon - You can do better than this.   You're making this gig  job  whatever you want to call it  much much harder than it needs to be....",1,14,DriverDriver6699,2019-10-15 14:15:34

I really crave that power over a company that has been cutting my hourly pay week by week for over a year. When is enough  enough? Are we capable of forcing the changes we demand  because they sure are not hearing our complaints  instead they are demanding more ""quality"" and effort as they reduce our pay further and further.  The first few weeks of new pay were about even with the old pay system. Now  most of the batches offered are low by 30-50%  especially the large orders that used to pay the best and earn the biggest tips. I used to get $100 weekly quality pretty regularly  now I can't get that even if nearly all customers rate. I consider my acceptance rate to be decent at 60%  just to stay active during the shift  but it means being forced to take some very poorly paid batches. I'm making enough to cover my car payment  gas and insurance  but the leftover keeps shrinking  and I have not yet received one question from a customer about why their fee for my fantastic service has decreased.   I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BEING ROBBED. Do you have a yellow reflective safety vest  and Will I see you wearing it in the aisles  brothers and sisters? What are our consensus demands  and what are effective ways we can make them concede? Can we shut it down 1 day per week? 3? 5? What would be a concrete line to draw to start the strike? When they've stolen $1 million collectively from the 70k workers? that's only $15 each  I'm losing that every day right now!

I have had several reporters and Washington State elected officials and activists reach out to me wanting to understand and maybe help our cause when it comes to our lack of pay transparency  general low wages  inconsistent work  and general dehumanizing work environment as instacart workers. I'm so thankful for their help however I am a bit overwhelmed with trying to juggle this and working. Here's where I'm at and what I could use from the rest of the community:  &amp;#x200B;  1) I will be doing another ""strike"" on 2/22 in conjunction with promoting the 22 cent movement. I will use the ""go online"" option (instead of selecting hours ahead which can cause reliability instances) and deny every single order with my demands for a transparent and livable wage in the ""other"" box as a reason. I welcome anyone who is able or wanting to join my efforts to do so.  &amp;#x200B;  2) I have one reporter who is looking for personal stories from those who have delivered Apoorva Mehta's personal orders to his loft who can confirm his lack of tips given to shoppers (I heard those shoppers may be on reddit somewhere!). She said she can write her article with anonymity if needed. If this is you feel free to message me directly and I can get you in touch with her.  &amp;#x200B;  3) Does anyone have any current legislation/action/lawsuits going with instacart outside of the 22 cent movement who could catch me up on the info? I don't want to walk over anyone else's work or waste time doing things that were already done but there are so many posts here I am having trouble finding if or when it was posted (linking me to specific posts is fine too). To be perfectly honest I'm probably just having trouble figuring out reddit in general ;)   &amp;#x200B;  Thank you all! ",1,5,AJohnson5488,2019-02-06 05:47:40

Call SH and fight for it,I don't know if something like this has been posted before but I've started to notice more and more on batches I've taken that there is no heavy order pay when there clearly should be. From a 48 pack of water with 3 cases of soda to a batch with 8 cases of juice boxes and a case of soda a 5-10 minute call on the way to the customers house with SH usually fixes it with a $10-$15 bump.

This would most likely mean not only stores running on a skeleton crew of non union managers  but a lot of the perishable deliveries would stop as many have a solidarity agreement with the union and/or because stores wouldn’t have anyone to work the product so would stop bringing anything in. Does anyone know if IC would recognize this or still send shoppers to complete orders there?

Yesterday while using the self checkout a store employee was watching me like a hawk.  After checking out the store manager tells me that using self checkout wasn't an option for me because I worked for instacart  which I don't  because I'm a 1099  all while the employee that reported me to her smiled as if he was some kind of war hero for catching someone using a green credit card.  So I went back and asked the shift lead  can the store stop me from using the self checkout  the shift lead said no  you work for yourself  you can use any lane you want.  Today I go back in and again use the self checkout  and the same thing happens again.  This time I've had enough  instacart says one thing  the store says the other.  I tell the store manager I'm self employed and shopping for myself  I'm not a w2 shopper.  I call instacart  the guy cancels the order and then tells me to go get the store managers name.  I reluctantly do this  but then figure out I mise as well enjoy being an asshole.  I push the groceries up to the service desk  say well since you don't want me to check out  instacart cancelled the order  they also want your name  because they are going to complain about this to your corporate headquarters.   Imagine standing there and saying that to an already pissed off store manager.    I turn around and walk out  and will probably never walk back in this store.  I'm a 1099  nobody is my boss  including control freak store managers.    Now it looks like I'm going to have to stop doing instacart and quit  because in this market there are only 2 grocery stores  and the one I'm talking about gets 75% of all orders.,13,23,paid2drive,2019-09-07 02:06:58

From the start it has been a disturbing portrait into the soul of humanity. Like many of you I have experienced stolen tips  dead times  back pain  passive aggressive customers  bogus feedback and having confused customers pull guns on me.   Yet thru this I have found a way of making on average $28 an hour. I have used my own bag of tricks to do this and I wont go into them here. But IC has been relatively good to me and has given me the schedule flexibility to maintain an unusual love life where I date multiple women and men  and serve as a dominant to them all in a complex tribe where by I can express my sexual prowess.   The point of this is that IC has been good to me  but I fully admit that its not really good to everyone. IC is terrible  particularly to certain kinds of shoppers...like the ones who will just slam $8 no tip orders.   For that reason I will be joining the strike and I encourage you all to do the same.

Instead  you scheduled the strike for Sunday  Monday  and Tuesday.  Monday and Tuesday are the slowest days of the week in my market.  What's the point of striking if it is going to be slow anyways?  Most of you are only focused on money and don't understand business.  You don't understand that there are other improvements that can be made to the platform besides increasing the pay structure.  You don't care about those other improvements.  You just want your pay increased and that's why you're only really striking on one busy day.  As each week goes by  I choose to work this platform less and put my time towards things that are more beneficial to me.  You all shouldn't waste your time stressing over things that are out of your control.  Instead of bitching  maybe you all should do the same.  There is money to be made out there and Instacart isn't the only way to make money.  Maybe you should Google ""jobs report"" and see that way more jobs are being added than expected in the U.S.  There are tons of other opportunities out there.  The fact of the matter is no one should be able to demand anything from someone who is paying you.  If you don't feel you are being compensated fairly  then move on.  For every one of you complaining  there are hundreds of others waiting to take your spot.  And for every one of you complaining  there are hundreds of others that don't frequent this sub and are perfectly fine with the way things are or they understand that it's not their place to make demands.  I'm sure some of you will respond and say that I'm an IC plant.  Go ahead and do so if it makes you happy.  I'm not an IC plant.  I work the Miami zone in South Florida.  I just feel that if this doesn't make you happy or if you're not satisfied with what you're earning  you should move on and find something that makes you happy in every way possible.  Like I said  I'm working the platform less.  And I know many others who were earning way may than me and have quit the platform because of whatever reason.  Life too short to spend it bitching ... especially when there are so many other opportunities out there.",0,17,305medicalthrowaway,2019-11-01 16:32:19

Instacart stops stealing tips and reimburses shoppers for stolen tips.. but then lower the base pay to 7 dollars for full service shopping and 5.00 for delivery only . once again instacart starts making way more money on every batch shoppers start making even less   So the results show that they always end up finding a way to pacify the people while putting more money in their pocket. so strike away  the results will probably introduce another way for them to make more money for themselves and cut your pay in some other way,2,42,SBaron1153,2019-11-03 15:29:22

Start with protests on street corners for a few weeks. This will raise awareness and improve participation. It also might be enough if customers stop using the service and a strike won't be necessary.   2. Make it longer than 3 days. A 3 day strike where people are saying  ""I'll just work extra hours next week to make up the money"" is ineffective. It tells IC  ""We want better pay  but are unwilling to sacrifice anything to get it."" A good strike is painful for both sides.  3. While striking  walk picket lines at stores. This will make the stores put pressure on IC to end the strike.  Because of the way this was done  there will be a slight drop in daily revenue for IC  but the monthly and annual revenue won't be affected at all. There really is no incentive for them to make significant changes because things will just be back to normal in a few days.

I worked about six hours and made $150.    When I wasn’t on shift  there were a few OD orders  none of which were high paying.  None of the orders I completed had any sort of peak boost either.    I can’t say whether or not the strike had any effect on my market.  Sunday’s are always busy here.  I met another IC shopper that asked me about the strike.  I told them I wasn’t participating and she was currently on an order so she wasn’t participating either.  I met a former IC shopper who moved on to Shipt and he asked me about the strike.  He asked why the strike was only 3 days?  I told him I have no idea and it’s probably because I’m not participating.  He told me Shipt is offering a $500 bonus in my market for for completion of 150 non promo orders over the next two weeks.  So  how was your day?  Did you strike?

Maybe this is all just a coincidence.    Anyways  I didn’t participate in the strike at all.  I worked because I know how to play the game.  I worked because I understand that  as an Independent Contractor  I’m not being forced to do anything.  And I worked because Instacart is Apoorva’s company and he is free to run it however he wants.    I don’t agree or disagree with any choices he makes because that’s his business.  I’m not an investor so I’m not providing any financial incentive for him to listen to me.  If the partnership I have with his company  Instacart  turns out to no longer benefit me  then I will walk away.  If you feel the partnership you have with Instacart is no longer beneficial  then you have the freedom to walk away as well.    I partner with many different companies and I recommend everyone else do the same.  I also would recommend that everyone (especially those complaining) explore their options with regards to starting their own company locally.  I don’t care for your complaining but I don’t doubt your abilities and I believe that  especially in this day and age  you can build something from the ground up and be successful.

0.0,0.2913,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",InstacartShoppers,The leaders of the strike on Facebook are IDIOTS.,I remember posting this in the IC national/USA group on Facebook on why the strike will not work only to get banned because they did not want to hear any other opinions. This new strike... will not work either. They keep doing these stupid strikes for no reason. The last one did not get your tip raised to 10% and this one will not get your tips raised either  and here is why.  First reason  it was for a limited amount of time. For any strike to work  it has to go on and on and on until the company heads decide to make a change. The reason nothing happened is because the strike was for only a day which the company heads can count as a loss. This strike had to go on for at least a month for any change to have been made.  Second reason  batches were sitting there getting boosted enough that people who were not striking decided to pick it up and make a killing. A majority of the orders still got delivered and the ones that did not ended up getting delivered the next day. This is why a short term strike never works. Media has forgotten about it and so have a majority of IC contractors.  Third reason  the plan behind the strike was terrible. Letting batches sit and get boosted up was such a bad idea I can’t even begin to tell you guys why. Like I said earlier  people who weren’t striking picked them up with a nice boost. Customers still got their groceries for the same cheap tip they have always been paying. Only difference was IC made less money due to boosts.  What should have been done  which I suggested in the Facebook group many times is that everyone should have kept picking up orders and letting them time out. Or  pick up an order  get the final notification  and have SH remove the order so you are not in any violation. Shoppers should have kept doing this over and over and over again until no one got their groceries delivered that day. This would have hurt IC way more than simply not taking batches. This way  very minimal business would have been conducted. And this method of strike should have gone on for at least a week or two so company heads would really feel how important it’s shoppers are.  I wish they had listened. We may have had better pay by now.,1,93,Black_Reclaimer,2020-01-15 13:08:24

Since the first strike near Thanksgiving when they removed the quality bonus  things were bad  but since today they have been absolutely the worst I've ever seen. Double orders where Instacart pays $7 (which is my zone minimum). 48 item orders where Instacart pays $9.58. 10 mile orders where Instacart is paying $7.93.  Why isn't there anything being said/done about this as a community? Literally if a batch isn't ridiculously heavy or isn't 15 miles worth of driving Instacart's portion of the pay isn't even reaching $10. Only tips make orders worth it now. Where's the big uproar about them paying us with tips now that it's the absolute worst it's ever been? I just don't get it.  Right now doordash orders make more sense as they pay about the same as what Instacart is offering but it takes less time and is less driving.,1,7,toyanucci,2020-01-21 22:43:28

These orders are bad for us and terrible for the customers. With the shelves bare  we have to make a ton of replacements and communicate a ton with one customer  it’s impossible to do this with 2 or 3 customers at the same time.   My entire screen is triple batches  there is no way I’m taking these. Please for self respect and fair treatment  STOP taking these multiples!

I have a few questions. Do the grocery stores prepare the order for you or do you have to “shop” yourself? What are some things you dislike about IC? Can you get stacked multiple orders at once like on other apps like DD? What are some popular grocery stores on IC right now besides Costco? Is there ever any peak pay where you can get a bonus per delivery?,1,7,ericpan96,2020-03-23 22:45:38

0.0,0.2985,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",InstacartShoppers,Was this because of the strike?,"Hi Shoppers  thanks for everything you are doing!  I know you probably have some not so fun customers you have to shop for  or may not really get to meet right now  so I thought I would share my story with you.  My family is a single income family and I am the one who is working.  My job is essential and I am able to work from home and due to high risk health issues and fear of infection  I had to force the issue with my employer to begin working from home a few days before our state began pushing the ""work from home"" issue.  Since that day  no one in our home has left for any reason.  My wife began ordering via IC and up to now we've had really good success.  She has been working hard to make sure all the groceries are sanitized before bringing them into the house.  One order took a week before it was filled though  which got me anxious and pushed me to try to help her out by taking the time to place an order myself without her knowing.  I am used to being able to stop on the way home from work and get things she needs and wanted to surprise her  but this just sucks.  I can't.  And it's not because I am disabled or anything.  It is simply the risk  it is just too high.  So  I stayed up until 1am working up an order for one grocery store  but due to an IC problem  was not able to place it.  I then went to the website for a grocery store that is walking distance from our house and found out that IC handles that store to.  I spent another hour-plus shopping for items at that store and managed to cobble together an order.  This time it let me place the order but said ""First Available - Saturday"".  At the time  I didn't know what that meant and thought it was going to be another week  since that is what happened with our other orders.  At this point I had forgotten about the strike  and submitted my order at 2am Tuesday morning.  Fast forward to 24 hours later...  It is now 2am again and I am confused as to what happened to my order.  I didn't have my phone with me all night because I thought the order was coming later this week.  When I picked up my phone  a single notification was waiting  which told me my order had been delivered.  There was no attempted phone call and no text messages.  What was my order?  About 30 items that totaled $140  for which I entered an up-front $20 tip for.  What I received was a single item  with all the other items flagged as either ""No Replacements""  ""Dietary Restrictions"" or ""By Your Request"" and all those items refunded.  I haven't had a chance to confirm stock status of some of the items I listed  but if they were all out of stock  then why did the shopper list them with other reasons  especially ""dietary concerns""??  Now trust is broken and how my order was handled feels like a joke.  Using me by getting me pissed off at IC doesn't help my situation and it won't increase my tip.  Anyway  I get the reason for the strike  I really do.  And if I could hand pick who shopped for me through all of this  trust me  I would make sure when I could that you got more of a tip then I can give right now!  Text me  call me  leave me a business card.  But don't take my order and then drop a single item that by itself isn't even edible.",1,12,CobaltCosmic,2020-04-01 06:38:43

While we mainly do restaurant deliveries  we sometimes get orders for grocery stores like Walmart and Safeway. Today I had an unprecedented number of Safeway offers - 16 orders in the span of 20 minutes from 8pm. I declined them all because I never take grocery orders anymore (and I'm not alone  many doordashers avoid them)  but I've never seen so many flow in continuously  and at such an unusual time too.. typically the most I see are 3-5 offers in the late afternoon.  My first thought was hey  maybe the Instacart strike is working and people are having to turn to other delivery services. Of course it could be other factors (shelter-in-place order for my region was extended yesterday so maybe people realized they need to replenish supplies) but in any case  I hope y'all get paid more and are given better protection.

I went to the store  collected all the items (40+ in each) and both times when I tried to check out I couldn’t. The payment was declined. I checked everything  ran it as debit  used the pin  even tried it as credit. Nothing worked. Contacted the customer explaining the delay. Contacted support. My first batch was at 9am and it took 5 hours to hear back from shopper support about the issue at which point I had been sitting in the store going crazy. They basically just cancelled the batch and said do another one. I was pissed and received NO compensation for my time. I picked up another batch around 5pm just to have the same issue. I told the support person in chat that if I was not compensated for my time both this morning and this evening I would be looking into taking legal action against instacart. Instead of responding they just cancelled the chat. I have screenshots of everything. If they don’t have enough shopper support personnel to handle MAJOR issues during shopping such as not being able to check out  then they shouldn’t be offering or running their service in my opinion. I worked 8 hours for instacart today  risked my health and used gas and got zero compensation. Not to mention neither of those people got their groceries as I am one of only 4 shoppers currently working in my area. Is this even legal??? What can I do?,1,12,AlphaKryptonyte,2020-04-05 02:21:33

0.0,0.5759,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",InstacartShoppers,Why are you striking over TIPS  but not WAGES? (Only in capitalist-obsessed America),"Look  I get that people need to pay the bills and whatnot  but I think the tipping culture we have here in the US is insane. Its essentially more corporate welfare  and I feel like its permeating nearly every job in the gig economy and getting out of hand.   Instacart workers are now pushing for higher tips being required  as if tips should be a requirement in the first place! This is presumably in response to the fact that Instacart shoppers are not being paid enough by their EMPLOYER  and so somehow  they think that customers need to foot the bill instead. If you are not getting paid enough for a job  you should not be working that job--that should be a negotiation between you and your employer. Its the inflated tipping that is keeping these jobs afloat and luring people into thinking ""Oh  yeah  I will accept a $5/hour job because I might get lucky and snag those 25% (or $50) tippers!"" with jobs/businesses that in a normal market equilibrium would never take off paying people that low! IMO  instacart shoppers and other workers based on tips are shooting themselves in the foot and slowly doing away with their own jobs by making such demands  because the customers can and will eventually go elsewhere. From our position  a price is being advertised for a good or service  and then fees and ""tips"" are being tacked on at the end  on top of the fact that there is this underlying feeling that the higher I pay  the better service I'll get it  which is inherently unfair when a price has already been agreed upon.   And now there's an article floating around saying that Instacart shoppers can choose which jobs they want based on the amount of tips (and their address  which opens to a whole nother level of possible discrimination)? No wonder people are baiting them with $50 tips--its just as unethical to have been choosing who to service first based on what they can afford to pay in the first place!   Also  people do not take kindly to paying for other people wages when there employer won't pay enough. Listen  individual customers are low-wage struggling workers too  and you are gonna make the argument that they should be the ones paying more during a crises rather than the employer that you work for that makes millions of dollars in profits by paying you peanuts while you fight with customers over $10 here and there (most of whom are laid off  low wage workers themselves  and can barely afford it)?   I think most people would be totally fine paying a flat rate (or percentage based) fee that was across the board  so long as it was factored into the total price. No game playing  no bartering  just money for service/good. But tipping has allowed discrimination to enter in  with shoppers literally ignoring tips they deem to low or not going to places they think might be ""the hood"" or in a poor area.    Consumers would rather either cut out the middle man and pay the delivery person directly  or directly pay the middle man a service fee who negotiates with the delivery person how much of the total fee they should get as a wage. This triangular trade relationship being kept afloat by tips is only screwing the customers and the workers  while the pockets of the business/employer get fatter. Why aren't Instacart shoppers striking about that??",1,7,AquaFlame7,2020-04-10 15:50:52

Although I’ve made a solid chunk of change  dealing with the app crashing  horrible customer and tech support  a pretty bad algorithm for assigning batches  and worst of all TIP BAITERS has got me thinking there’s definitely a better way of doing things.   Also in researching a bit into instacart  it seems like the company doesn’t really give a shit about these problems  and although striking does send a message to the company  it hurts the customers  and a lot of those customers really do need us in this time of need.   Instead what I’m contemplating on doing is using instacart as a means of getting my own name out there to customers after I deliver their orders. By this I mean leaving my contact info to customers so if they are interested they can pay me directly instead of using instacart as a middle man. I mean  we are putting ourselves at risk for a service that many elderly and compromised desperately need  and instacart is not listening to the workers and customers pleas for assistance in many of the problems going on. So I’m gonna hit them where it hurts  their wallet  maybe then they will listen.   No more algorithms herding us into horribly batch pay  no more shady corporate business (like stealing workers tip money to subsidize wages)  and no more allowing for people to scam us with taking away promised tips.

I'm usually ranging from 1 to full 4 bars on any given area. Have MetroPCS powered by T-Mobile with unlimited data.   I have awful reception at home with or without wifi and orders kinda dissapear on me. Got one later today but it was the Costco from a block away  orders in the zone were much harder to get and so were orders from the two zones near me.  I start to get antsy when I'm in an area where my signal is low and start looking to leave  anyone else do the same?  2. I've been able to snag a few good orders the last 3 days being near that store  a few miles away. It'll usually come by itself after a refresh and not with multiple batches. This is good news  this makes me think proximity is vital to the batches you'll see.  3. The algorithm seems to be fluid. We've seen changes day to day. Yesterday most orders were in my zone and a few near the next zone. Today  not so much.  It reverted back to the past 4 days where we were seeing batches from all over the place.  I guess the overarching question is what are the trends you've noticed with the app's algorithm but that seems way too complicated right now lol,1,4,Skills-,2020-05-07 01:07:00

Just saying—it’s worth the few minutes to get the bump you deserve.  It is concerning that the heavy pay wasn’t already included in the IC payment.  Also  if a customer ADDS something heavy  after delivery go to support and fight for the bump. This happened yesterday when a customer added  a 12 pack  of soda and two 1 liter cokes.

Our shoppers did a great job  and the second one communicated really well during shopping!     As noted in our other post  though  we placed an order (our third) with a 1-week turnaround time  which we figured was ok based on everything going on.  The day it was supposed to be delivered  we received a text saying it would be delayed by at least another **week**.     So: 2 week turnaround time for orders - seems high  considering it appears as if some orders are being turned around relatively quickly.

0.0,0.5695,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",instacart,Why are shoppers striking for increased TIPS  but not increased WAGES?,"Look   I get that people need to pay the bills and whatnot  but I think the  tipping culture we have here in the US is insane. Its essentially more  corporate welfare  and I feel like its permeating nearly every job in  the gig economy and getting out of hand.  Instacart  workers are now pushing for higher tips being required  as if tips  should be a requirement in the first place! This is presumably in  response to the fact that Instacart shoppers are not being paid enough  by their EMPLOYER  and so somehow  they think that customers need to  foot the bill instead. If you are not getting paid enough for a job  you  should not be working that job--that should be a negotiation between  you and your employer. Its the inflated tipping that is keeping these  jobs afloat and luring people into thinking ""Oh  yeah  I will accept a  $5/hour job because I might get lucky and snag those 25% (or $50)  tippers!"" with jobs/businesses that in a normal market equilibrium would  never take off paying people that low! IMO  instacart shoppers and  other workers based on tips are shooting themselves in the foot and  slowly doing away with their own jobs by making such demands  because  the customers can and will eventually go elsewhere. From our position  a  price is being advertised for a good or service  and then fees and  ""tips"" are being tacked on at the end  on top of the fact that there is  this underlying feeling that the higher I pay  the better service I'll  get it  which is inherently unfair when a price has already been agreed  upon.  And now there's an article  floating around saying that Instacart shoppers can choose which jobs  they want based on the amount of tips (and their address  which opens to  a whole nother level of possible discrimination)? No wonder people are  baiting them with $50 tips--its just as unethical to have been choosing  who to service first based on what they can afford to pay in the first  place!  Also  people do not take  kindly to paying for other people wages when there employer won't pay  enough. Listen  individual customers are low-wage struggling workers  too  and you are gonna make the argument that they should be the ones  paying more during a crises rather than the employer that you work for  that makes millions of dollars in profits by paying you peanuts while  you fight with customers over $10 here and there (most of whom are laid  off  low wage workers themselves  and can barely afford it)?  I  think most people would be totally fine paying a flat rate (or  percentage based) fee that was across the board  so long as it was  factored into the total price. No game playing  no bartering  just money  for service/good. But tipping has allowed discrimination to enter in   with shoppers literally ignoring tips they deem to low or not going to  places they think might be ""the hood"" or in a poor area.  Consumers  would rather either cut out the middle man and pay the delivery person  directly  or directly pay the middle man a service fee who negotiates  with the delivery person how much of the total fee they should get as a  wage. This triangular trade relationship being kept afloat by tips is  only screwing the customers and the workers  while the pockets of the  business/employer get fatter. Why aren't Instacart shoppers striking  about that??",1,29,AquaFlame7,2020-04-10 16:35:28

My wife and I are retired (mid 50's) and thought it might be a good way to earn a couple of extra dollars this winter.    I was looking on their website and their rules and one of the rules is no guests.  This includes spouses.  So my question is how would they find out if you tag team a shop?    Does anyone else shop with a partner?,3,16,Emailman1,2019-06-09 19:53:19

This is a lengthy post detailing my experience as a new shopper  with emphasis on the major mistakes I've made from day 1  and what I have learned from them.   Ok. So I started with Shipt on 8/23/19. I had ZERO idea how zones worked in my metro thus resulting in choosing a zone based on how close the stores were to where I live. 🤦‍♀️ That was my first mistake...  Well  to my surprise  my first day of shops I learned how those zones worked in reality... the majority of order offers coming in had drop off locations 30+ minutes away from the store! As such  my AR rating TANKED that first day  right from the get go. (Below is my first ever weekly scorecard 🙄- we will talk about that avg customer rating in a second here.)  https://i.imgur.com/BE9dxmM.jpg  I was so ill prepared for the zone structures and how they operate. The hub didn't explain that some zones would spit out orders with drop off 30+ minutes away from the store!   The most valuable advice I can give any new shopper is this- Do NOT shop your first order until you've reached out to LOCAL shoppers so they can give you the lowdown on the zones  how they work  so you can choose the RIGHT zone from the beginning  and not make the same mistakes I did. Because that mistake was only the beginning of my my downfall...😫  Then got a surprise low rate on one of my 5 shops...with no feedback whatsoever (as shown in scorecard above)  did my first 2 shops  the next day I shopped 3 orders (total of 5 for that week). Got my weekly avg back to 5. See below  2nd https://imgur.com/a/nbUgFBi  Then I had to take 2 weeks off and my 14 day obviously went to NA. Did 2 shops and another low RATER! Tanked my stats yet again! Mind you I take pride in my work  and am always going above and beyond. I never once had any impression of a negative shopping experience from the members. And alas the halt of improving my AR comes into play. See stats below..  Stats over time https://imgur.com/a/thU8Mio  So I kept shopping from metro and hoping for improvement before week ends  but sadly my last few orders have yet to rate. See below..   Final stats end of week https://imgur.com/a/NNtPfJv  In conclusion  this is life being stuck in the pit as a new shopper that started with a bad rating  that I was given ZERO negative feedback on  as per the weekly scorecard. It is very discouraging  and frustrating! I have very nice insulated bags  I communicate appropriately  have never been late  etc. Always had positive exchanges with the members through shop to delivery. No feedback. Bleh. End of my rant I suppose.   How do I climb out of this hole?! I really enjoy shopping for members which makes me work even harder at satisfying customers  with no results...thank you for reading my rant/plea for help.,2,4,tragedyerotica,2019-09-23 14:48:04

I took last week off from shopping to just get some personal things done and I'm so glad I did because on Friday there were videos of people protesting on the freeway  some people vandalizing cars and trying to pull people out of them.  I worked in a different metro before Covid because I was in the area for work anyways  and never did the metro near where I live until after I had no more work. I don't know my area well enough to chance going to any open promos nearby since I might just end up in the middle of a protest.  I could go to the other metro to work - even though most of the Targets in the area are shut down  the ones nearest to where I am are up and running. But I still face the same issue of possibly hitting the protests when I get home. Not to mention the curfew in my city.  I'm just very frustrated and scared to even really leave my home at the moment. I'm okay money wise for the week  and I did put quite a bit in savings just in case something happened and I couldn't do Shipt due to coronavirus or if for some reason I get deactivated  but I'm just a little scared to leave my home now.

Basically  all it serves to do is it shows the company that it should keep doing what it's currently doing: pay your drivers less  cut back on customer support  increase menu prices  and continue using deceptive strategies to bring in more merchants and drivers.  The only way that drivers have any chance of actually getting a decent base pay and 100% of tips is by showing the company that they can't keep getting away with this. Companies don't respond to employee outcries  they respond to public outcries and litigation.  And to the people that are happy with the current pay model  or that it wouldn't make financial sense to pay us more: just look at GrubHub's pay model if you think DoorDash has a good pay model. On GrubHub:   - I actually get a flat base pay  - I actually get to keep 100% of my tips  - They even pay me for mileage (it's not perfect but it's something at least dammit).   - And to top it all off  as if all that wasn't enough  GrubHub guarantee's that I'll get paid $x.xx / hr if I didn't make enough through base pay and tips  they contribute the difference to make it up.   THAT is what I want to see from other rideshare companies. And it is possible to do it  but we have to stand up for ourselves and tell them that  because companies don't respond to employee outcries  they respond to **public** outcries and **litigation**.,1,16,confused_boner,2019-02-13 19:47:57

0.0,0.5302,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",doordash,HEAR ME OUT. Why we shouldn't be fighting DoorDash on how it uses the customer's tip to subsidize our wage.,"Think about it. People on Instacart are making the same amount of money now as they did before their recent pay change (took place on Feb. 19). Sure  tips don't subsidize wages. Now mileage is a part of it instead. They also added the fuckery of defaulting the tip the customer gives you to 0. If the customer blindly orders without paying attention  he/she may not even notice. Unless your customer likes tipping in cash or specifically asks if there is a tip  I think a lot more IC contractors will be getting $0 tip at all now.  So here we are with DoorDash. Yes  wages are subsidized by tips  but we still get paid well. Think about it. All we do is drive to the restaurant  pick up the food  and deliver it. Instacart workers are getting **nearly the same amount of pay as we do** and they have to drive to the store  shop for the order  go through checkout  load it up in the car  drive to the customer's house  unload it. It takes much longer  is much more effort  and pays the same as us. So yes  I think we are doing well for what we make per delivery with DoorDash.  But why am I saying this? All DoorDash has to do is recalculate how they will pay us. Everyone here thinks they're going to just pay the exact same except not use the customer's tip to subsidize the wage. That's what we all thought Instacart would do and we were **wrong**. As mentioned above  they recalculated how the wages are decided and now we make the exact same amount of money (possibly a tad less with the default tip being ""0"" now) as before the change.  What can DoorDash do if they stop subsidizing our wages with tips? * Lower the minimum guarantee and have a daily promo period where you do 80% of your offered deliveries during busy hours. Think of it like Postmates. EVERY night in my area they have an $8 promo period. However  with that $8 promo I make literally the same amount of money per order with Postmates that I do with DoorDash. They could do the same thing but make qualifications for the promo pay difficult. How would you like to be paid $4-$6 per delivery unless you accepted 80% of your batches? * Pay less per mile that we drive to the restaurant and customer's house. * Not pay mileage driving to the restaurant at all. * Change how much it costs to use the service  causing some customers to quit using the service and lowering business for drivers.  That probably isn't everything  but I hope you understand my point. If we fight this ""tips subsidize the wage"" payout  DoorDash will simply pull an Instacart and find a way to not pay us more money or worse pay us less (a la Postmates).",12,39,ADestinShopper,2019-02-23 22:34:30

I've been using the company pretty much weekly for several months. Our orders are normally $80-$100. We haven't had any trouble until recently  almost every order for the past few weeks has been missing items(could be attributed to the restaurant)  but last night's experience has me never wanting to use Door Dash again.   We ordered $102 of food. At 8:55 I received a text that the driver was arriving. 4 minutes later I got another text saying the driver was having trouble locating me  and gave me a number to call the driver. I called 3 times and never got an answer. At 9:04 I received another text saying the driver left our order with a neighbor. We checked all the departments close to us and no one had received our food. I attempted to call customer service and the recording said to expect a 20-30 minute hold time  so I used the app to chat with customer service. When I signed in  I was #220 in line. When I finally spoke to someone  they attempted to call the driver and also got no answer. To further insult me  the rep tried to offer my $102 as a credit for food we didn't receive! I was told I would be getting my refund in 5-7 business days. I posted my experience on their Facebook page  and noticed there are quite a few complaints similar to mine  and Door Dash hasn't responded to any of them in the past 24 hours. With a 30 minute phone hold time  and 220 people in line to chat with customer service  and so many complaints on Facebook  it's almost like the company is giving up.

I fail to understand why all the negativity and hostility toward doordash here.  I started dashing as a side gig to supplement my student loans in my free time. Doordash has allowed me to easily make another $200 a week with just a couple hours a day. I have tracked everyone of my dashes in a spreadsheet and average $15 an hour. Most of the time I just look for when my area is busy and dash for an hour or two. I love the flexibility  driving generally relaxes me and I only have to deal with people for a moment and 99% of those people are generally appreciate me.  I am content with the current pay system. I know upfront if the order is worth it to me. If I make anything more  well its a nice bonus.  The couple times I have had an order  i have found support to be very helpful and generally reply immediately.   I have had my share of slow restaurants but this is not DoorDash's fault. I either just wait patiently or decline the order. My main job has a fair amount of work I sometimes need to bring home so I usually just bring my tablet in and get it done while I wait.  My only complaint is of the stability of their servers. I get that things happen. Why not just relax for a few minutes  be patient and just dash when it comes back online?  This will probably be downvoted to oblivion with all the cynicism here but I am sure there are some who will agree Doordash isn't that bad.,43,56,onpointrideop,2019-08-02 19:38:13

0.0,0.5327,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",doordash,Those that oppose the upcoming new pay structure  help me understand. A breakdown of my trips on DD and UE.,Before I ask  I’m here to understand your viewpoint. Not to argue. I really don’t comprehend how anyone can be against it. Here’s how I look at it.   Many of you say that DD pays you the guarantee even if there is no tip. Well of course! They are supposed to.   Let’s look at UE and PM for example  they pay you for the pick up  time  mileage  and drop off. The pick up and drop off alone are over the 1$ DD pays at minimum.   DD guarantees are based on estimated time and mileage. This is essentially what UE and PM does  except they pay you for it completely. Then add on the tip. What DD does is  they estimate all of this beforehand (which is the guarantee)  the take your tip and add it to the payout to minimize what they pay.   Yesterday I posted about a Wendy’s order where I got paid 8$ without tip. That order took 40 minutes. Some commented how we are lucky that DD still paid that amount. However  for a 40 minute order  UE would’ve paid that amount before tip.  Here an example of similar trips I made:  1.  DD - for the 40 minute order  got paid 8$ with no tip.  UE - for a 35 minutes order  I got paid 10$ BEFORE tips.   I ended up being paid 15$ for the UE order because of a 5$ tip. If I had been tipped those same 5$ in DD  i still would’ve be gotten 8$ (1$ DD  5 tip  and 2 DD)  How is DD beneficial in that scenario?  2.   DD - for a 15 minute order  the paid me 6$. 1$ DD  3$ tip  and 2$ DD.   UE- for a similar 15 minute order  UE paid me 4.5$ before tip. Sure it’s less than DD right? But then I got tipped 5$ making the total 10$. If this was DD  I would’ve gotten 6$ (1DD and 5 tip).   —  The only rare benefit is in DD short non tip orders. Where they still pay a good amount for a short trip. The lowest I seen DD offer is 5.50$  which is great! For a similar short non tip order  UE would pay about 3.50$. The thing is  I see 90% of customers tip in DD  so in realty this is rare. UE is also getting more and more tippers that end up making the payouts the same.  —  Please let me know your thoughts. I just can’t comprehend how some see the current system as beneficial.,2,19,em23942,2019-08-20 01:44:53

So  basically  according to doordash  I don't qualify for the early access scheduling (3 pm) by 2 points (completion rate is at 93% instead of the required 95%). Because of this  they put me in the 12 am bracket. However  every night at 11:59 PM I waste my time refreshing the app to find that NOTHING ever releases for my region (or any region that is less than 20 miles away). After nearly 3 weeks of trying to get help from the useless support team (to no avail)  I realized that the reason I am not getting schedules for any of the areas within a 20 mile radius is because doordash is deliberately only giving schedules to early access dashers  while the rest of us are only given the LEFTOVERS  ergo NOTHING because there's too many early access dashers taking the schedules!  For starters  doordash did not even notify me of these changes via email  I actually had to call and request one after finding that I could nolonger see the schedules  3 pm. I've been dashing for an entire year  putting up with every bullcrap that this company has thrown at me  only to get flipped off and not be able to work ever again because I'm 2 points away from a qualification? (And yet I'll be paying those taxes by the end of the year)  So  I'm sorry if this question sounds stupid as heck  I'm no expert in legality stuff  I'm just so pissed off that I am desperate to get back at them. Is there any legal action I can take? Are they allowed to discriminate and deny us work based on ratings?",0,38,procrasteen,2019-09-09 04:48:20

I very much dislike this new pay schedule for three very important reasons. 1. People in my region refuse to tip for Fast Food orders and we do not have good restaurants open past 9-10pm. 2. I'm literally declining 70-80% of the orders I receive due to little to no tip amounts. This is problematic due to the fact my region is home to 15 000 college students (with only 110 000 residents in the city limits) which houses a fairly large percentage of people seeking to make their own work schedule by applying to doordash. The competition is unreal and it seems doordash allows way too many to be scheduled before filling up. 3 We are independent contractors. I don't believe there is any law that would prohibit doordash for allowing us to choose between two pay schedules so long as we consent to it.   How can a company  in good conscience  offer someone 2$ for ANY delivery service. 2$ for 1 mile is one thing  but 2$ for double digit miles and a red card order is absolutely disrespectful to me and my time.  Do not start the ""Don't accept the 2$ order"" obnoxious argument. I don't accept them  but it is absolutely impossible to bring in a viable source of income past regular dinner peak hours due to people thinking that ordering a 20$ or less delivery order doesn't warrant a tip.  I propose that when you decline an order  use the ""Other"" section of reason for declining and typing in ""#LetUsChoose.""  Even if you prefer the new schedule  please do this for those of us that prefer the old schedule.",0,12,DoorDash4Cash,2019-09-13 02:15:13

0.0,0.2778,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",doordash,I took the correct course of action?,So I delivered a Denny's order to this customer. He was very polite  a very nice fellow. I go back to my car and start adjusting my phone and turning on the car when the customer comes out. Again  he was very nice about the whole situation  and tells me that one item was missing. He order a ton of pancakes and bacon and there were many bags. Most were closed and so when I was at the restaurant  I did a quick check of the items  but with the sealed bags  it was impossible to tell if everything was there. So  I explained to the customer that the best thing to do would be to contact DD through the app and let them know there was an item missing and they would send someone else to fix the order. I did the right thing  did I not? I felt bad because he was super nice and I almost told him I would go back to see what I could do  but it is raining like crazy here and I didn't want to lose time trying to fix Denny's error. I say their error because we as delivery drivers  are not supposed to open sealed bags so I couldn't tell what was what.,1,10,alejandroandraca,2019-12-30 05:50:09

2.0,0.4804,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",doordash,Customer thinks DoorDash drivers are all part of a collective hivemind who knows everyone's exact delivery preferences.,"Disclaimer: I'm not the greatest when it comes to directions. At all. If I'm getting somewhere  it needs to be very clear where I'm meant to go. Vague directions are just a recipe for disaster. Vague directions at night are ten times worse because for some reason the world looks radically different to me in the dark. So this story is partially my fault.   Went to deliver an order last night to a fucking huge retirement community in my city. I say fucking huge because it's relevant. It was like several different top tier  expensive apartment communities scattered throughout a massive plot of land that could possibly have been its own small town. For now  we'll call the community Retirement Town.  Now  the customer had provided no delivery instructions at all. Just the address. Said address took me to the main office building of Retirement Town. I pulled up into the parking area when I got a text from the customer that said  ""I am at Wellington (name changed).""   I frown and park the car to look around. There is nothing around me except a sign in front of the office building that says  ""Retirement Town Resort Lifestyle Communities."" The office building has large apartments attached to it. Across the street is another sprawl of apartments. There is no Wellington to be found.   Not a problem - she probably was one of the night employees and just set the address to the main building. Usually when this happens  said employee either has someone get the food for them or walks out to meet me.   I circle the Retirement Town main building a bit. No Wellington.  I text the customer. ""Sorry  I'm not sure what ""Wellington"" is?""  Customer: Where are u  Me: I'm in front of an office building with a sign out front that says  ""Retirement Town Resort Lifestyle Communities"".   Customer: Ok ur at the front come around the corner u will see Wellington  When she said ""come around the corner""  I thought she meant that the apartments attached to the office building were called ""Wellington"". So I circled around some more. No dice.   Went to the front desk. Asked WTF was a Wellington. The lady at the desk provided directions similar to my customer  with the addition of saying I needed to make a right and continue around at the stop sign.  There were two stop signs; one for LEAVING the office area  and one for going around. She did not specify  so I kept thinking I'd missed something as I kept circling within the apartment community tied to the office.   Eventually  I texted the customer to ask if she'd be willing to meet me where my GPS had dropped me. As I waited for her to reply  I drove out of the office area and made a right. I don't remember why  but I think I'd reached a point of frustration where I was going to drive everywhere to see if I could find it.  There was Wellington. *Fucking* Wellington.  Turns out  ""around the corner"" was around a bend  then another couple blocks down from the office building where my GPS had dropped me. I admit  me being terrible with directions and also being very tired and trying to navigate an area of town I didn't know existed was partially my bad. But ffs  why hadn't she set the address to the ACTUAL address where she worked? This was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OFFICE BUILDING AND APARTMENT COMMUNITY FROM WHERE SHE SET THE ADDRESS.  I park back at Retirement Town main building  where she meets me. She's in the car with her friend  and both of them look at me like I just vomited on their shoes. The customer starts explaining to me how to get to her building if I ever had to deliver there again. Wording it in a way that implied I should've known this  even though there were no fucking notes in the delivery instructions. As if we *all* should know this  or if maybe she'd had previous delivery people come by who didn't have trouble. Her friend kept an eye on me the whole time  looking like she was waiting on me to try something.  I just stayed polite and nodded and said I'd keep that in mind and handed her her food and drink and drove off. Went home for the night.  Here's a few tips for anyone ordering food to their workplace:  * Add fucking delivery instructions if getting to you is going to require some extra steps.  * Put in the correct address of where you work. Especially if you work in one of several different office buildings. Don't just slap in a generic address and hope for the best.  * If the address and your location are different  at least TRY to be where you said you'll be.  * Doordash drivers do not have a collective database of everyone's exact location and where they want their crap delivered.  * **Add your shit to the delivery instructions because that's why it's there.**",1,14,QuantumDrej,2020-01-06 02:27:00

2.0,0.4484,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",doordash,DOORDASH DRIVER INVOLVED SHOOTING 17-APRIL (ROUND STRUCK CAR),Hello   I know that I’ve previously posted as a Door Dasher advising against entering apartment complexes or places dashers feel unsafe and did not receive entirely supportive or understanding feedback – both in light of COVID19 hazards AND general safety precautions of entering stranger or foreigner complexes and areas to deliver customers food.  Needless to say  I want to take the opportunity to once again emphasize how important our safety as Door Dashers is  especially given the growing climate of fear and instability in the United States  both as a scholar and as a human being.  Your safety is the most important thing  first and foremost  and also your customers safety.  Last night around 11PM EST I was speaking with and handing a customer food when a shooting started about 17 feet or less away from us. I immediately pushed the customer to go inside right away  and obviously ran for my life – included in other images and pictures.  To my surprise  during the shootout my vehicle (left hazard lights on) was not stolen.  However  my vehicle was shot.  Thankfully  I am unharmed in this specific instance.  Once again  I encourage total  constant vigilance when approaching  interacting with customers  and being mindful of your surroundings at all times.  These are difficult times. People are desperate – many recently coming into “money.”  Please be safe.  Thank you  Mods: feel free to cross-post or contact for further verification. Obviously  a police report has been made  and my dashcam was also running during the entire counter before  during  and after the shooting – including when my vehicle is struck by a round.  Stay safe.

We are out working and at rick and all I see are people complaining about things that are out of our control. Doordash isn't giving out PPE like they tell the media they are.  I am tired of the commercials from DD pretending they care about the restaurants.  They don't care  this is just good marketing for them.  The longer this goes on  the better their business does  but have they passed any of that on to us in the form of hazard pay or even bonus pay?  Last Friday after the app crashed  I was screw out of two orders which would have been almost $25.  Doordash gave me a dollar to make up for it.  Really?  Customers who have the luxury of staying home are complaining about the speed their food arrives.  Walmart deliveries are so ridiculous I refuse to ever do them.  I could go on and on  but I'm just wondering how long do we all put up with is?  I don't understand the people doing gig work that accept the low ball offers?

2.0,0.3418,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",doordash,Karen has officially joined DoorDash,"Looks like the newly-laid-off soccer moms are starting to join DoorDash - in fact  I found Karen today at the Thai restaurant I was picking up from.  I was waiting patiently at this restaurant that I know well - I was told it would be about a 10 minute wait  which I was fine with because the pay was great and the owner of this particular establishment is actually honest when he says 10 minutes (I actually probably got my order in 7-8 minutes). I notice a white Chrysler Pacifica swerve into one of the very front spots  ignoring the fact that it was supposed to be a curbside pickup spot. Of course  I halfway expected Kathryn Hahn to emerge from the van like in the Chrysler commercials  but I got full-on Karen instead. Local baseball team cap  tied ponytail  midlife crisis mom  she slams the driver's door and speedwalks to the door with this look in her eyes like she's on a true mission.  She opens the door and before the door can even close  practically yells out  ""DoorDash!"" No name  nothing like that  just yells it out. She gets no response because everybody was busy in the kitchen. She goes to the little pickup table  which is of course empty  and mutters something under her breath (I'll take a wild guess and say it was probably vulgar).  ""Excuse me!!!!"" she bellows to nobody in particular  sounding just exasperated at not being paid attention to for 15 seconds. Eventually  the owner  who's the sweetest lady in the world  comes out and asks for the name on the order. Karen sighs  makes a big show of taking her phone out of her back pocket (why why why do so many women do this?)  and practically grunts with effort at having to unlock her phone and scroll down to read the name.  The owner of the restaurant says it will be about a 5 minute wait. FIVE MINUTES. Karen clearly doesn't find this acceptable  and just turns away from the owner without even a word. She finds me in her field of view standing with my DoorDash bag ready  and hones in  talking to me so that the owner can clearly hear.  ""Oh  you too! How is this acceptable? Are we paid to stand here?""  I don't even say anything because I don't know what to say. She continues   ""Is this *normal?* What's even the point of DoorDash?""  At this point  I just tell her to be patient  it's only 5 minutes. She exclaims  ""oh STOP "" and quits paying attention to me. After calling back into the kitchen with no response a couple more times  her food comes out. She just glares at the owner as she grabs the food and leaves. No eye contact with me either.  The cherry on top is that of course  Karen is one of those douchey people who remote starts their car when they are directly outside of it. She remote starts it  but the doors are locked  so she has to fumble for her keys again and unlock  probably cursing under her breath. She guns her Pacifica out of the parking lot.  Point of the story is that they are among us  folks. The Karens are infiltrating DoorDash. Is this the end?",1,167,MasonRudolphsHelmet,2020-04-30 06:46:03

Let Us Help You  ➤  How to Calculate Damages in a Slander Case   ￼  Slander occurs when a person makes an unprivileged false statement of fact that causes harm to that person or his or her reputation. Determining the amount of damages in a given slander case can help the plaintiff and lawyer determine the potential value of the case and if it is worth pursuing.   Types of Damages  There are a number of different damages that a victim of slander may suffer. These include:  Actual or Special Damages  Actual or special damages are compensatory damages. These damages are intended to return the plaintiff to the position that he or she was at before the slander occurred so that he or is she is basically in the same situation as he or she would have been not having been wronged.  Actual damages can be calculated   FIND MORE LEGAL ARTICLES  SEARCH  to a certain dollar amount. They include all those damages that the plaintiff directly suffered due to the slander. This may include lost wages  lost earning capacity or loss of business opportunities. These may include the actual amounts lost or the amounts that are likely to be lost because of the slander.  To calculate lost earnings  the plaintiff can add up the wages that he or she lost from being out of work because of the slanderous statement. This also includes any employment benefits that were lost  such as using sick days or paid time off to deal with the slanderous statement.  Lost earning capacity is more difficult to prove and generally requires expert testimony. An expert may have to testify about how the plaintiff’s diminished earning capacity will affect his or her lifetime earnings. For example  if a person was working a $100 000 job and the slander caused him or her to be fired and to be ostracized from the position and was only able to earn $50 000  the annual amount of damages would start at $50 000. Reasonable pay increases based on the individual’s employment record would also be taken into consideration  as well as his or her prospects for promotion. Inflation may also be taken into consideration.    An expert may have to evaluate a variety of evidence in order to determine the difference between the plaintiff’s projected earnings before the slander in order to compare these with the projected earnings after the slander. The economic expert may examine the plaintiff’s tax returns  the current and projected economic state and the industry in which the plaintiff is employed and was employed.  If the plaintiff was a business owner  his or her losses may include the loss of existing clients and the lost business opportunities. Former clients may be called to testify that they stopped doing business because of the slander. An economic expert may be necessary to testify about the economic impact of such lost business opportunities and business goodwill. Actual damages also include the out-of-pocket expenses that the plaintiff has to pay because of the slander  such as the amounts he or she paid to a psychiatrist.  General or Non-Economic Damages  Another category of damages that may require calculation is general or non-economic damages. These damages are meant to compensate the victim for his or her damaged reputation  mental anguish and pain and suffering. This area of damages can be used to compensate victims for public humiliation  shame and disgrace.  Non-economic damages are assessed by the judge or jury that is hearing the case. If the case settles  the value of non-economic damages may be negotiated between the parties and their respective lawyers. Juries may be instructed to use their own reason  belief and experience to determine an appropriate amount of damages.  Some jurisdictions do not award victims of slander with non-economic damages. Some provide these damages to victims only if certain criteria are met  such as if the plaintiff was wrongfully accused of committing a crime or was significantly affected by the slander. Some states limit non-economic damages to victims of libel  written defamation  and not to oral defamation.  Punitive Damages  In some cases and jurisdictions  punitive damages may be assessed against the defendant. These damages are established to punish the defendant for egregious conduct and to deter similar conduct in future dealings. To receive punitive damages  the plaintiff may be required to meet a heavier burden of proof.  Mitigating Damages  Plaintiffs are generally required to mitigate their damages  meaning that they should take reasonable steps to minimize the damages that they suffer. For example  if the plaintiff is offered a similar job after losing another one due to the slanderous statement  he or she should generally take it. Otherwise  the defendant can argue that the amount of damages should be reduced by the salary that the plaintiff would have had if he or she took the position.

The highway I was speeding on had at least 4 lanes apart with not a single car in sight besides me and the cop.

Also just kinda playing devil's advocate.,I get that because of the whole 'tip after the delivery' thing  tips can be a little uncertain  but like %80 of the time I still get a tip. And since it's groceries for old people on the coast of Florida  they are nice and tip well. Easily doubling my profit.   Usually I'll only except Walmart orders that are at least $7 without the tip  so that even if I do get screwed on the tip  I'm still making $7 in like 30 minutes  which is good enough for me  especially since I know that most the time I still get tipped.  And while I'm here I'll mention I've only had great experiences with their curbside grocery pickup. Their workers are fast and respectful.

2.0,0.2177,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",doordash,We’re fighting with the wrong people,Scrolling through this sub I can tell that there’s a lot of issues with Door Dash. Coming from someone who works at a restaurant I dread Door Dash orders.  The reason why is because even with choosing a longer prep time  Door Dash sometimes sends drivers to our door within in 5 minutes of just barely getting the order. It’s not our fault  nor the driver’s because I understand they try to accept many orders. However it can be frustrating having to tell them that we just got the order and it won’t be ready for another 10-15 minutes.   So really  it seems like the problem here is Door Dash and their algorithm. They give Door Dash drivers options to pick up food when the food hasn’t been set ready yet or even close to being ready which seems to causes frustration for drivers having to wait an extra long amount of time.,1,0,vegantac0s,2020-08-09 09:27:55

4.0,0.3961,"time, week, hour, work, call, thing, minute, long, wait, put",doordash,Booze delivery + rich people entitlement = Murphy’s Law in action,This one’s a doozy and a text wall; sorry for the length.  Yesterday I schlep about half an hour from home to a different (and wealthier) zone because there’s a $4 lunch rush promo. (No biggie  I needed to go to Sephora and that’s where the closest one is.) A $12.25 delivery pops up where the merchant (a liquor store) is right around the corner and the “customer” (scare quotes to be explained shortly) is less than 15 minutes away. Sounds good to me.  Get to the liquor store  the dude is super nice and has the *$75 bottle of Scotch* I’m delivering all ready to go  and I set off toward the destination. Now  the delivery instructions section was completely empty. I arrive to find my destination is in a gated community. I’m already swearing up a storm but I try to reverse engineer this dude’s name from “First Name  Last Initial” to the opposite and find him in the callbox directory. There’s no one that could possibly be right.  I hop across the street to a regular neighborhood and park and call the customer. He explains that I am in fact not delivering the Scotch to him  but to one of his work colleagues as a gift. I explain that I have to scan his ID and he replies that he’s not even there but in another town about half an hour away. I tell him I’ll call support and see if it’s kosher to scan the colleague’s ID as long as they still meet all the alcohol delivery requirements  and after the standard ten minutes on hold am surprised that DD said it was okay. I call the customer back  tell him that we should be good to go  and he says that he’d inform his colleague  who would meet me at the gate “in a minute” (his words). A little weird  kinda inconvenient especially after the fuckery that’s already gone down  but okay  sure.  Since no other visitors were really trying to come through  I chilled in the visitor entrance lane for ~7 minutes  getting increasingly pissed by the second. After no sign of said colleague  I text the customer and tell him that I’d generously spent more than enough time waiting per DD policy and would now be returning the Scotch to the store  and get the hell out of Dodge. He replies  asking me to wait “just another minute”  so I call him and very politely tell him tough titties  toots  but I’d already left after having gone above and beyond what was required and wasted ~45 minutes of the lunch rush.  (Question here: the “unable to deliver” screen told me that I would get 1.5x pay in situations like these. is that right or did I have a petit mal seizure?)  Once parked at the liquor store  I call and sit on hold with support a second time  explaining exactly what happened. I guess since I didn’t call the customer from the “unable to reach customer” page  I needed to (lose a ton of face and) CALL THE CUSTOMER AGAIN just to reset the five-minute timer and let it run out again  despite it being at 0:00  at which point I could clear the delivery on my end. (She also reassured me it wasn’t my fault and would be documented and not hit my metrics.) Again  fine  whatever  anything to get out of this dog-and-pony show. I call him and hang up after a few seconds a couple times and even try sending a nice text explaining that I was sorry to bother him but I had to do this for technical reasons. Neither works; the clock stays at 0:00. I return the Scotch and the liquor store guy gives me a knowing and sympathetic look like he’s dealt with some shit like this before. By now  the promo’s over  so I book it to Sephora  where I call  wait for  and speak with support a third time because I’m still locked into the delivery. This agent says she’ll mark it as complete/canceled/whatever on her end  I ask about the 1.5x pay  but it sounds like she’s answered the call inside a wind tunnel and I can only make out about 1/3 of the rest of what she says. All I can make out is something about extra money. I have an auditory processing disorder  so in these situations it’s even more difficult to understand speech.  After dropping a solid 4x what I just made during disasterlunch at Sephora because I’m an idiot  I notice $5 in “delivery pay” sitting in my account. I assume this is the extra money  but  uh  12.25 x 1.5 does not 17.25 make  at least where I come from. (By the way  agents 2 and 3 seemed to have no real idea about the 1.5x pay thing.) I haven’t done it yet  but goddamn it I am calling support tomorrow and getting my extra $1.12 or  in my wildest of dreams  even more  given how much time was wasted during a promo. Also  given that base was $3  that means this rich guy only tipped me $5.25 to play Expensive Booze Courier. I’ve only been at this a couple weeks now and my first booze delivery was not that bad despite a couple mishaps.  Side note: in the 2.5 weeks I’ve been at this  the incentive to recruit new drivers in my area went from $400 to fucking *$1200* and then $1300 like two days later. Even if it’s an Accounts Payable nightmare  those fucks can afford to throw a few more bucks my way.  tl;dr: Rich dude thinks I’m a discount courier  wastes close to an hour of my time during a two-hour  $4 lunch promo  and Tony doesn’t even compensate me what the app says I’m entitled to. Also it’s 100° out and the air is full of smoke.  Anyone else ever been in a situation where they couldn’t complete a booze delivery (but not because the customer was stumblin’/didn’t have ID  etc.)?,1,10,BettyCrunker,2020-08-21 08:06:45

I am a Dasher in the Snohomish county area where the first U.S. coronavirus case was detected.  As many of us know  it's a bit nerve racking to say the least to be out and about doing everything we can to keep from being infected while visiting numerous restaurants and attempting to keep our distance to all we come in contact with.  If it wasn't for us delivery drivers  many of these restaurants we pick up for would be currently out of business  so we are a necessity for sure and Doordash relies on us to put ourselves in harm's way so that they can continue to make that almighty dollar.  The fact that we are all still working through this pandemic with absolutely zero hazard pay is ridiculous and an insult to be frank.  There is no doubt that many reading this petition will eventually succumb to the coronavirus. It's going to be a statistical fact. I see a lot of older individuals dashing now and some of them will not see the end of this crisis  yet we keep on keeping on.  I typically wouldn't take the time to post something like this  but this virus is the real deal. Even if you are younger and not worried about the virus  you should be worried about becoming asymptomatic and then spreading the virus to those around you that may not fair as well as yourself such as your parents or grandparents or even your friends parents or grandparents.  Since we are literally in the front line of fire when it comes to the coronavirus  I think that each and every Dasher that puts themselves and their families lives in harm's way should be compensated.  On top of our regular deliveries we should all receive an additional $5 for each and every delivery we make until our government has given us the ""All Clear"".  There is ABSOLUTELY no good reason that Doordash hasn't already launched a coronavirus hazard pay for all it's Dashers. The companies within the delivery industry should have all already done this on their own.....we shouldn't even have to ask  but be as it may  we need to make a show of force  otherwise  it's just business as usual for the Doordash corporate elites  all the while dashers are getting sick and or dying.  In order for a strike to work  we all have to rally together so I think it would be best to let this post marinate for a couple of weeks until we know that we have the numbers to pull off the strike.  Let's make the strike date for April 15th. That's will give us two weeks to share this post with each and every Dasher that we come across or already know.  I don't think that asking for an additional $5 for each delivery is too much to ask. Quite literally  our lives and our family members lives are all at risk with each and every delivery that we make.  Once we hit 1000 signatures for this petition I will reach out to a number of news outlets so that our cause gets a little publicity.  Please sign the petition   http://chng.it/ZRcTMpmM  so that we can show Doordash that we are all standing together on this one.

Needless to say  I want to take the opportunity to once again emphasize how important our safety as Door Dashers is  especially given the growing climate of fear and instability in the United States  both as a scholar and as a human being.  Your safety is the most important thing  first and foremost  and also your customers safety.  Last night around 11PM EST I was speaking with and handing a customer food when a shooting started about 17 feet or less away from us. I immediately pushed the customer to go inside right away  and obviously ran for my life – included in other images and pictures.  To my surprise  during the shootout my vehicle (left hazard lights on) was not stolen.  However  my vehicle was shot.  Thankfully  I am unharmed in this specific instance.  Once again  I encourage total  constant vigilance when approaching  interacting with customers  and being mindful of your surroundings at all times.  These are difficult times. People are desperate – many recently coming into “money.”  Please be safe.  Thank you  Mods: feel free to cross-post or contact for further verification. Obviously  a police report has been made  and my dashcam was also running during the entire counter before  during  and after the shooting – including when my vehicle is struck by a round.  Stay safe.

As a full-time DoorDash driver  I know that many fellow drivers are concerned about their chances of being infected while on the job.

Tbh it’s a first offense DV charge  so now I got the notice that DD won’t onboard me  but I’m already on and my app is still working. Is my app just going to shut off at some point? Is there anything I can do to fight this? I heard there are laws that protect you if you have already been a contractor and completed onbording. Any advice helps.

THE FRAUD: Let us say that New York City has a Quest promotion of $8.00 for every 2 rides completed. You turn on your UberDriver app on your satellite synched smartphone. You receive an offer at 6:01 that you accept and finish only to find that your Quest counter only shows 0/2 Quests completed. You contact UberEats helpline and they tell you that their records show that you started that dispatch at 5:58 so it doesn't qualify. They then tell you to email support. You email support and their first pre-scripted response requests screenshots! Without screenshots  you have NOTHING!  WHAT YOU MUST DO IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU:  A. First you must screenshot your first incoming dispatch before you accept it.  B. Now screenshot the screen that shows the call with restaurant address  map and time stamp in the upper right hand corner of your screen.ll  C. Click on the order and find the 'Waybill' screenshot a copy of that.  D. Screenshot a copy of the Quest promotion including times and locations.  E. Screenshot a copy of your Quest counter that did not register your 1st trip.  NOW WHAT DO I DO?    Send me an inbox alerting me that you have documented all of they above information. I will then put you in touch with the law firm that will be representing us.  HELPFUL TOOLS:  Download Screen Master at Google Play Store or on Apple. Always have it set and ready to shoot before you sign in and start your Quest.  (The reason I suggest this program is that it overrides UberDriver and leaves a side button to screenshot. Sometimes if you press your down button and on/off switch on Android you will get a screenshot that shows your volume which would block the time stamp rendering your screenshot worthless)  Thanks In Advance,1,0,BronxTomos,2019-01-04 20:53:45

Lol,"Would like to offer my personal experience and insightful theory into how Uber Eats uses it's data driven strategy to compensate me.  I'll have an evening  reeling in 25 deliveries  23 out of 25 customers tip... I'll make on average $240-$280 in 6 hours. BUT the next day I ALWAYS get **85-95% less tip money and less tipping customers.**    It's beyond my comprehension to fathom the idea of my smiling  talkative  friendly  engaging customers just 180'ing back into their home and saying themselves ""fuck that guy  I ain't tippn him"".... And then enjoy their food with the idea they fucked the delivery guy over LOL? It evidently always happens to me the day after I DING Uber for $300 bucks......   Uber is 100% stealing my tips. 95% of my customers tip me and I'm very grateful to serve them. It's satisfying to say the least. But always  after a high tip rate evening  I get literally 3 out of 25 tipping me and the hourly pay is significantly less... Use caution when working for Uber Eats  If you are for them in the morning and day time then you're probably getting used like a blow up doll by Ubers data driven algorithm they spent countless hours developing.. The people protesting $9/hr albeit they work full time during the day like a normal job.    It's so obvious they're stealing tips I really thought Uber was slicker then this lol.   Guess it doesn't matter  what am I going to do? Call tech support located in southeast asia? You could tell them your dad died 20 minutes ago and thats the issue  she won't relay that to management. They are basically robots. This is why all these other redditors are posting here with issues regarding customer serivce. They are fucking horrible. Non-fluent English speakers obviously being out sourced. Pathetic how I'm supposed to call them my 'co-workers'.    My ratings currently at 99%  and I've had customers that offer food   water  beer  weed  bathroom  and the best  a positive interaction which leaves them feeling good...Good people do good things  I always tip when I order food or eat at a resturant  I get by mostly all of my customers.. But the day after those high paying nights man.. I always get an awkward tip rate  obviously being taken by the computers.  Final Chapter -  All Good Things Must Come To An End.   I am 100% convinced Uber Eats is stealing my tips.... The severe crash or bust on my daily closing Uber profit  that expands back to a while..   proves they are stealing tips to average down the hourly rate the next time I work... Enjo $48 an hour today - pay for it tomorrow at $33 an hour  Perhaps  since daddy did it  that means I can do it....  Maybe it's time I start taking fries  nuggets  wings  anything pickable   out of my deliveries.....Or even a quick sip.  They'll tip me anyway  heck  they'll give me a high rating...

I recently was notified by the Uber app that registration was expiring. I registered online  complied with DMV and registered on time. Unbeknownst to me  DMV only gives a receipt of the registration which is valid in the courts and for chp in order to drive until you receive the official paperwork  which can take up to 30 days. Once the driver registers online or at DMV  there is no way to reverse the process and go to a kiosk for same day print of tags and official registration papers. Once a driver  like myself  who didn't know about the kiosk or that DMV wouldn't print you out an official form  the driver is stuck waiting for the paperwork from the DMV and out of work for up to 30 days. I went to the local Uber office and they said they can do nothing about it and that many people in the last 4 years have complained about it. Why is Uber not adhering to the rules and how is it fair to the driver to not be able to work for up to 30 days when complying with DMV? Many people  like myself  rely on UberEats to pay their bills and rent. Uber is unnecessarily putting drivers through this situation and not paying them. They should have a large red alert that says you MUST register at a kiosk since we do not comply with California's vehicle code section 4606 or allow the driver to upload DMV's official receipt and give them 30 days to upload the official paperwork when it arrives via mail. This has caused me to lose up to $1500 a week plus bonuses. I think Uber should be responsible for this for every driver that had experienced this issues.

However uber controls our pay and I say 3 dollars is too low. Doing basic math we can see that if you get no tips for 8 hours but get 3; 3 dollar offers per hour that would be:  pay $3 x 3 offers in a hour = $9  $9 per 3 offers x 8 hours of work = $72  However this is not always true because sometimes you dont get offers or need to eat lunch:  $72 per 8 hour work - 2 offers for lunch/bathroom break = $66  Everyone loses $20 worth of work because of the need for lunch/bathroom break  So what if it is only 2 offers per hour?  2 offers per hour x $3 = $6 per hour  $6 an hour x 8 hour work day = $48  The less offers you take the less money you make in Ubereats. This $3 thing is impossible to live off  if we do a week worth of Ubereats:  $72 per work x 7 days = $504  $66 per work x 7 days = $462  $48 per work x 7 days = $336  per month (In FL the lowest rent is somewhere in $200 and $400 per month  then to pay for phone bill is $25 if you have a deal  food is somewhere in $100 if you know good places  if you dont use the house electricity is about $50  water to keep clean is somewhere in $50 too.)  Cost for car insurance because FL requires it = lowest i can find is $300 per month for me age under 30.   FL rent monthly total bill: $725 a month worth of Ubereats with only maybe $200 gain. Oh but wait the taxes so is somewhere in $100 - $150 gain. Then spending it for gas which maybe is around $50 gain.  $504 x 4 weeks = $2 016 per month  $462 x 4 weeks = $1 848 per month  $336 x 4 weeks = $1 344 per month  This is only possible if you do get constant pings not randomly or no offers in 2 hours. The lowest pay 1 per hour is super bad:  1 offer per hour x $3 = $3  $3 per hour x 8 hours = $24  $24 per day x 7 days = $168  $168 x 4 weeks = $672 per month is unacceptable amount to live in FL  This is unacceptable  many other food apps are either full or dead. Ubereats is a multi-dollar company with many services like Uber air. Food delivery is booming not Uber air or Uber connect.  We must protest so we can get better pay  the whole rejecting $3 for anything higher than 3 miles is not working. We need to do the same thing like Uber drivers did  instead we dont go online it will be 100% no drivers to pick up food.

I applied to Grubhub a couple of days ago. Today I received an email about a ""pre-adverse action notice"" on my background check  processed through Checkr  due to something on my driving record in 2003. Anyway  I applied to do bicycle delivery  so I wouldn't think that my driving record would matter too much. Interestingly  I had no issue with my background check on UberEats. In any case  do you all think I should email them  or does anyone know of a number I can call to talk to a real person? I'm not quite sure how to proceed.

Most restaurants don’t care and treat you as any other customer. However  twice now I have come across a restaurant that adamantly does not want to be associated with GH. I can understand and respect that. I do call in my orders and don’t mention that it’s for Grubhub but will absolutely tell them if asked. I don’t hide the giant red Grubhub letters on the card. I am not openly trying to hide the order is from Grubhub but I am not advertising it either.   Both scenarios of the restaurants getting upset I did end up getting the order. I tried to be sympathetic and give them whatever information they requested. The second time it happened it was a total mess. The customer would not answer and there was so many things that were wrong or could go wrong with the order. They got nothing but ranch for their salads  the 7” ‘mini pies’ could only be special ordered so I went with the standard 3” mini pies. Had no idea what kind of pie besides fruit so we went with random ones.   The one thing I did that I feel good about was let the customer know (in both scenarios) that the restaurant really does not want to be partners with GH and please pick a more friendly restaurant or order directly from them. The first customer felt terrible about it and was so kind. The second one seemed a little more rushed but I think she understood.

Almost 2 weeks ago  I worked a bunch  accumulates $822 and grubhub just had the money disappeared and they refused to pay me. This is an update to an earlier post some of y’all may remember. Well  I had been emailing them CONSTANTLY ever since that post and before it  basically going in a circle. Here’s how it went:  GH: hi what’s your issue?  Me: I’m told my payment was returned due to an issue with the bank some time last week. I’ve since updated the info  but the money just disappeared off my account. What do we need to do to get the money in the right account?  GH: I am very sorry to hear about your issue. The returned payment has been reissued to your grubhub account. Please refer to your pay summary to confirm this.  Me: *looks at pay summary to see $6.11 added*  My payment wasn’t returned. There’s still over $800 left.   GH: Hi! Your issue was resolved. If it wasn’t  please reply to this email and we will get right with you!  Me: My issue wasn’t resolved! The wrong amount was sent to me!  GH: I’m sorry to hear about your issue. Please provide to me your name and phone number so I can pull up your account  Me: *provides info and describes issue again*  GH: I am very sorry to hear about your issue. Please contact driver accounting to get this resolved.  RINSE AND REPEAT  I’m not joking ABOUT 7 TIMES. Until I get pissed enough yesterday after they say   “the returned payment was only $6.11 and it has been reissued. The pay statement you sent us has nothing to do with the funds in question”  I tell them I’m done  and I’m going to drive my ass 3 and a half hours to Chicago and file suit against them for my pay PLUS any damages that would be incurred as a result of them not paying me  because that was my rent money  and my landlord is the type to evict as soon as possible. I’m also already behind on child support and my internet bill  so that 800 wouldn’t even cover everything. The money I’ve accumulated in between would have to go to those. I was dead serious too. I’d drive 7 hours for $800 that was effectively being stolen from me. Well  lo and behold  later on that night  someone from driver accounting  after a week of this hell  actually CALLED me  apologized like any supervisor would  and immediately issued $822 to my driver account  and it was available for cash out this morning. Idk if it was because they knew I could actually sue them since I’m not too far from their physical presence  or if that rep knew they fucked up and actually got their supervisor involved and the supervisor took care of it out of duty to the job and desire to help those who need it. Either way  I’m glad to finally get paid for my fucking work. They had ended up sending me like 10 bucks additional in “returned payments” during the whole emailing circle. I’ll just chalk that up to interest.,1,27,isinedupcuzofrslash,2020-08-24 12:08:48

(Defendant) for breach of contract and unlawfully taking tips that were intended for their delivery drivers.  DoorDash is a national food delivery service  and the case arises from their improper conversion of tips directed and intended for drivers.  DoorDash is an on-demand food delivery service which delivers meals from national 📷restaurant chains and local restaurants  as well as groceries from places like Wal-Mart.  When a customer places an order with DoorDash  a customer has the ability to leave an additional gratuity  or tip  for the DoorDash delivery drivers (called “Dashers”). The default “Dasher Tip” is currently set to 10% of the order  but the customer may also leave a custom tip.  In terms of compensation to its drivers  DoorDash promises each driver a guaranteed base pay for each delivery job  plus 100% of the gratuity.  However  DoorDash does not remit the full amount of gratuity that a consumer leaves for a Dasher.  Instead of paying this tip to the Dasher  DoorDash actually uses the gratuity to cover its costs for the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers.   For example  if DoorDash promised the Dasher $5 base pay for the delivery  and the customer tips the Dasher in an amount of $2  the Dasher still only gets $5.  On its website and other marketing materials  DoorDash deceptively advertises and represents that a gratuity can be added for a delivery and that the driver would receive “100% of tips” from the customer. DoorDash does not disclose that it keeps a substantial portion of this additional charge for itself as its own additional revenue to offset the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers. This deceptive compensation scheme is illegal and violates federal and state law.  HGD attorneys Jim McDonough and Lew Garrison bring the action on behalf of the Dasher plaintiffs against DoorDash  Inc. for breach of contract  negligent misrepresentation  fraudulent inducement  conversion  unjust enrichment  and violations of consumer protection laws.  The lawsuit seeks the return of tips rightfully earned by Dashers in order to remedy DoorDash’s improper withholding of those tips  which resulted in Dashers not receiving 100% of the tips that were intended for them.

Usually  I do these things quick quick because I use public transportation and I am not trying to add to the delays the NYC MTA already metes out on me. I go in and I'm like ""I have a PM pickup"" showing them the order on my phone (as I always do). Person behind the counter hands me two bowls. I don't necessarily check anything but I note quickly that my customer ordered 2 items so hey out the door. So these was one of those deliveries where the customer is texting  calling-""where are you?? Where's my food"" (had to do another drop-off b4 hers). Finally  I'm at her door handi g her 2 bowls of food and she's like "" oh  that's not mine! This is mine"". I'm like ""wait there are 2 items"".

I have been working through them for about a month now. The most common complaint I see is about pay. It keeps getting lower and lower. Currently there is an ongoing protest campaign called ""Blitz Up"" that is aiming to increase our pay.   Not only do I feel that our pay should be higher per order  but we should also be compensated if we get an order and they cancel 9 minutes later. I have gotten several orders where they have done this. I accept the order only to drive  15 minutes  6 miles in traffic only to have them cancel. Time is money  and miles equals gas burned and more money lost.   What I propose is a cancellation fee. Not a flat fee  but a cents per minute and cents per mile cancellation fee. This way we get reimbursed for the time wasted and the mileage wasted.  Is there a place that we can send suggestions to the company?  Anyways  June 15th we are protesting. We are going to demand that we get the pay that we deserve. They can hire Martha Stewart for a commercial and pay millions to play it online and on TV but they cant pay their workers decently....

Only issue is rn the second emails background check is taking some time and I'm wondering if it's because I'm using the same identity for each account. I haven't done a delivery with the account using the fake email. I currently have two post mate cards and bags for the two separate accounts. I wanted to wait for my real emails account to go through before I did any deliveries but I'm wondering if I did deliveries using the account with the fake email account would it be fine.

""Independent contractors"" pick and choose which jobs they want to accept  not Postmates regardless if you find it beneficial or not  its a breach of contract!  2.) Theres nothing in our contracts that states we will not be paid for miles driven to pickup location. Our contract states we will be paid for the pickup and we are to be paid for mileage but nothing in there states we should NOT be paid for the miles driven to the pickup location. We are owed for all miles driven to the pickup location.  3.) Orders that are canceled AFTER you accept them are supposed to result in a payout but they dont because again Postmates is breaching contracts. You are not employees that get paid hourly regardless of volume  you are independent contractors! When a driver accepts an order that is an AGREEMENT! if Postmates cancels the order after you accept it  they are responsible for payout or open themselves up for a lawsuit.  4.)

I certainly have though!!   I found out about postmates from Craigslist when they were a brand new start up!! I remember they worked out of a shared office space in Santa Monica and where posting about how to make money fast.    We also had to do an in person orientation and take pictures.   One of the biggest differences was the tipping procedure!! I sh*t you not  when we used to deliver food  I’d had to give them their items and then give them my phone so they could sign AND tip (!!) in front of me!! Not gonna lie I used to get wayyyy more tips when it was like this because obviously people tip you more in person. They ended up changing it probably 6~8 months after because customers complained.   Also we used to be able to deliver in n out!! I’m not exactly too sure what happened  but I think in n out told them to take them off their platform because they couldn’t guarantee the quality.   There used to be a sign up schedule so you’d get priority!!!   Also  which is probably obvious  the app has improved SO much. I used to have to log onto my internet browser  go on their site  and then see how much I was making per a job.   So what has changed since you started?,2,12,roxi94,2019-09-07 22:23:05

I've literally spent THOUSANDS of dollars in the last year on Postmates. I regularly place $60+ orders.  In the past few months I've had a couple of messed up orders  (missing items once; one time received the completely wrong order meant for another customer) that I got refunded or credited.  Tonight I placed a $60 order before tip. The $9 pretzels and marinara sauce were left out of my order so I reported that. Postmates replied back apologizing for the missing item  saying they'd work to make sure it doesn't happen next time  then adding that after reviewing my account they cannot provide a refund or credit.  It took a few back and forth emails of me politely explaining my frustration to finally get a refund. Really irritating. It's not so much the $9 but that they are being jerks over charging me for something I didn't get. I'm sure the restaurant just accidentally left it out or put in the wrong bag to someone else but Postmates is the person charging  has the order details  etc and should handle this situation quickly and them deal with the restaurant if need be since they are the one paying the restaurant. I also use this app especially because I do not like talking on the phone or dealing with that kind of thing.  I'm not constantly complaining and I'm a big spender I'd assume so to me it should be a no-brainer... Of course someone making tons of larger orders is going to have a few more issues than someone that rarely uses the app.  Consider me unimpressed with their customer service policies.,1,6,dustout,2019-12-14 04:54:57

They could up delivery fees (customers will definitely order anyway)  reducing executive bonuses or six-figure salaries    Does anyone know of any resources for organizing?

I got the canned “policy” response email for my assertion that I have a negative review left on my profile simply because someone got charged for cancellation fee—which means I’m eligible for the review to be taken down  but they’re not doing it. It was for an ongoing open job  and this client had unrealistic expectations from the beginning  and because I had other jobs  I couldn’t return in the timeframe they wanted  but they asked for me back. We confirmed my returning. Then I returned. She wasn’t home and said she gotten someone to do the job. I invoiced her for the hour. The client did a 180 and started blasting me in a review and complaining about TaskRabbit charging her for an hour.   Now TaskRabbit wants to play both sides against the middle  and they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to charge her for the hour  but they’re allowing her negative review to stand—even though she clearly states in our messages she would like to return.  This is ridiculous. I just need to get someone to actually investigate this and see that the policy defends me and the review should be removed. Any advice? Any email contact somebody has that can help me out?

I'm a full-time college student that picked up Wag! as a side-hustle last June. Overall I've had no drastically negative experiences  but when business started slowing down in my area I did some sniffing around. When I found the Wag! walker Reddit community  I read so many horrible stories about multiple aspects of the company.   Their newest policy is what has stressed me enough to reach out here... Walkers must keep an average rating of 4.75 or their account will be deactivated within 30 days of falling short. Some who fell victim to this have said they went without a final paycheck! With all these strict policies  I'm worried they might start doing something shady to less active employees such as myself one day. I love working with dogs  but my education is my first priority- and that's why I wanted to come here.  I'd like to know the basics of Rover- the how-tos  the pay rates  etc. -and see if it's a good idea to switch or even keep both. I'd hate to give up the rewarding experiences of animal care  so any information would be greatly appreciated!,2,2,Kingdom_Hyaenidae,2019-11-04 00:30:08

Normally I put my dogs in the kitchen with a gate up during pick ups because it can be chaotic but like a fool I left them out. My bossy English shepherd decided to correct my other dog because she was also getting excited and a fight broke out between them. Of course I jumped in and separated my dogs but in the process I got bit.  One trip to the immediate care later and I have a broken middle finger and my index finger has punctures and bruising. They put me in a compression bandage  a splint and on strong antibiotics.  I KNOW better. I'm usually so much more aware of the situation. I can't believe I let this happen and in front of a client no less.  My guest dog is fine and everyone did well during the stay.

4.0,0.4599,"time, week, hour, work, call, thing, minute, long, wait, put",RoverPetSitting,Two dogs I was walking got into a violent fight and I brought one to the vet-what happens now?,Hey guys. Not exactly sure what I am asking here but I am just kind of shook by my walk yesterday.   I was walking two dogs belonging to one client. Out of nowhere  the larger one attacked the smaller one and just gripped onto its face with its jaws. It was so merciless and bloody. It would not let go  I thought the big one was going to kill the smaller one! Thankfully someone heard the scuffle and ran outside to help me drag them apart. I took the smaller dog to the vet while the owner drove in from out of town. Injuries on the little guy were not pretty but not immediately life threatening.   I am wondering if anyone has ran into anything like this before? I called Rover right after the incident and they told me that I handled the situation perfectly. Then  in the follow up email they asked if I wanted to reimburse the client. I'm shocked!! I put myself in danger trying to get this unpredictably violent dog back into its home and then spent extra time driving the other one to the vet and waiting. I get that bringing it to the vet is part of the job and I empathize with the client because it's obviously terrifying getting a call Christmas night that your pets are injured. But  seriously  I was working on a holiday  I was scared for my safety and put extra time in  yet Rover wants me to reimburse them? Seems pretty whack to me.   Also  Rover did not seem concerned about the violent dog at all. Any idea if they will allow it back on the site? If so  is there any way I can warn other sitters/walkers? I did ask Rover support but they haven't gotten back to me.   Thanks for any thoughts you might have on the situation!,1,3,getitbitch100,2019-12-27 06:58:36

My last two jobs required me to care for and walk dogs regularly  but I would in no way say that I have “professional” dog experience akin to people that have worked at vets or dog training schools  etc. But I do have experience with walking and dog-sitting for my current employer quite regularly  and with my experience nannying &amp; housekeeping  I am very trustworthy with people’s pets &amp; their personal belongings.   However  I do plan to get Red Cross certified for pet aid &amp; CPR  which I know will look good on a dog-walker profile. I also volunteer at Best Friends Animal Society but don’t have tons of experience with that yet either.   I am also a bit nervous about the possibility of walking large  hyper dogs with behavioral issues. For those that do dog-walking for various people  is this something you encounter regularly? My biggest fear is dealing with a dog that behaves aggressively around strangers or other dogs.   Do you think my lack of experience thus far will prevent me from getting consistent clients?  Should I wait until I have more experience with the animal shelter/wait to get CPR certified before applying for a dog-walking job?

They responded thanking me for the good customer service  let me know that they received the replacement and that it is perfect  and also changed their review to 5 stars.  &amp;#x200B;  Fast forward 3 days later. They broke their product and lost one of the parts within one day. They complained about having to ship it back the second time  so I offered to pay for the shipping. Since they mentioned they lost one of their parts and don't know where it is  I pointed out that my policy does not cover lost parts  but I would be happy to replace it for free as a one time courtesy since they are another Etsy shop owner. I actually copied the main concepts/terms of the repair policy from another Etsy shop  but I didn't think anyone would actually lose a part so this is the first time I'm dealing with it.    &amp;#x200B;  In response to my message  which I thought was reasonable  this person BLEW UP on me and said my offer was unacceptable. Honestly  it seems like their entire message is trying to pick a fight. They even told me I was being rude by offering to replace their lost part as a courtesy. I am not really in the mood to apologize to someone when I feel like I've gone above and beyond  so I have just stopped responding to this person until I can figure out how to respond to them.  &amp;#x200B;  That said  I don't know what I'm supposed to do next. I'm tempted to refund/cancel so they can't do any more damage. During the time their review was 3 stars with a snarky review  I lost sales on that listing. I have a feeling that I can't make this person happy and they will leave an even snarkier  lower review regardless of what I do for them. Some people are just unhappy to the core  and I don't want to risk losing more sales because of something I cannot fix.  Another reason refunding seems like a good idea is for my mental health. I have a lot going on in my life right now  and I just don't have the energy or time to deal with the type of negativity brought by this person. I literally feel like my brain just shut down when they blew up on me in their last message.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand  I am a one-person shop and this is a $100+ order for a customized product I cannot resell. Plus  I have a lot going on in my life (see above) so refunding this order would be a huge hit.  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR:** I delivered a replacement to a complaining customer (that happens to be another Etsy shop)  which they claimed was ""perfect"" until they broke it. I believe that I went above and beyond by offering to pay for the shipping  and replace their lost part for free  but the customer blew up on me.

I'm looking for insight as to how often I should run sales  and how that would impact me in the long run. I'm a fairly new shop  and I'm a frequent Etsy Buyer  so I'm on both sides of things  and would just like some insight.  Those of you who run sales often  how does this impact your regular buyers when you aren't running a sale? Do you have frequents who only come around when you have a sale? Do the people who purchase from the sale funnel into frequent regular buyers?  As a buyer  if I know a shop frequently has sales  I would only purchase from them if there's a sale. I'm not sure if I'm a minority in this case  I'm sure some other people do it too but not to how big of an extent it is.   Thanks in advance!,3,4,Jalter_x,2019-05-15 18:11:54

I hope I am in the right place for this post  but I see many successful people so that's always a good sign. I need advice / guidance  to anyone willing to listen.   A life goal of mine is to have a side project of doing something that I love  creatively. Something with Etsy and of course awesome Summer markets. But I haven't been able to hone in on exactly how to obtain this goal.   My main skill is something along the lines of advertising - I can take a boring template and edit it  add to it  and make it something beautiful and unique. My biggest downfall is I cannot draw at all. So sometimes I find myself looking at Etsy and purchasing artists beautiful creations - vectors and graphics (for example  I bought some cute strawberry artwork) and put them together for a Strawberry Festival flyer  and it was a huge hit.   With that said  my passion is stationary. I love notebooks  to-do pads  honeydew lists  planners  life planners  mousepads  inspirational print outs. How do I connect these thoughts and create something unique that can turn to product?  &amp;#x200B;  then it branches out to a few different thoughts like:  1. I would love to make a notebook where I could control what the text says at the top of each page. but not many printing sites offer that option (one I use often is Zazzle  and I customize the cover and select the paper type  but doesnt allow paper customization)  2. I would feel weird about buying graphics and then using them for re-purposing (even though that's what they are for??) -- I think my question here is  does anyone else feel this way?  3. I roll into some self-doubt like am I even truly creative enough to do something  4. I talk myself back out until I see something I wish I could make changes on. 5. I find myself wishing there could be a creative teacher that could help me piece the puzzle together.

I went from Etsy taking about 15-20% in fees for ads and other to now Etsy taking 50-60% of my total earnings.   Look  Etsy would be nothing without its makers. We’re the customer and they are playing games with our livelihood. The problem for sellers has always been  “what can we do about it?”   I propose a massive seller cyber walkout by using the vacation mode feature. If thousands of sellers agree to go offline en mass  it’s the only way that Etsy is going to remember who actually feeds them. If sellers are willing to sacrifice 24-48 hours of activity for the good of everyone  then we’ll have some bargaining power and leverage to affect change. What do you guys think? If enough sellers go offline together  it will hit them where it hurts and perhaps encourage the board to reconsider the aggressively greedy approach of the company’s new leader.,1,9,GirlAnon323,2019-11-08 19:22:15

The direction etsy has been taking with sellers over the past 12 months is only getting worse  and it isn't a safe place to run a business  as you have no idea what scam fee or policy they will implement next.  So I firmly believe that if enough sellers band together  to put their shops in to holiday mode as a protest  this is the only thing that will change their policy.  We should all do it at a specific time and date  if this could go viral as it were and enough sellers did it  even for 24hrs it would ring alarm bells in the etsy HQ.  The key to this would be to:  * Publicise it on as many SM platforms as possible  as an upcoming 'event' * Send emails to all the tech websites and others that have done write ups on etsy's business * Set a date and time to shut down your shop.. first 24hrs  then if no response 48hrs  I'm open to suggestions  I know how upset people are with etsy and how many are planning to leave  so why not give it a go  if enough sellers did it  it would work.

Previously  when the ad system was changed to remove max CPC and combine Google and Etsy ads  many of us  including myself  protested by changing our ad budget to $1.  I would like to protest this new change as well  but am wary of using vacation mode  as I know it hurts search ranking. I don't even use it when I am on vacation  as I prefer to reduce inventory count and drastically increase processing times.   I have been trying to think of other ways to protest where I can better understand the impact of my actions - there is only anecdotal evidence on how vacation mode affects the algorithms. I also want the protest to be visible - the opposite of vacation mode.  What if we instead drastically raised the prices of all of our items to the same amount? If every sticker  necklace  and vase was priced $5 000?   \- The average customer will not notice our shops missing if we set them to vacation mode - but they will notice if everything on the site has the same large price.   \- Other shop owners that aren't on any forums may see the prices as well  and seek out what is going on and join us.   \- This will also be more visible and easy to report on for the media  using screenshots of search results that are all $5 000.  We could also  if we want to  add an image to our listings to briefly explain what we are doing.  (FYI  I understand that this new ad system may be a good deal for some sellers. I would prefer that this thread not become a slap fest about ACOS or the value of having more sales. I also understand that Etsy owns this platform and I can leave if I want. I am already doing well on another platform and understand diversifying - but that doesn't mean this concept isn't worth protesting. As one of the over-$10k sellers  my issue is the lack of consent. I agree with one of the comments on the Verge article: mandatory is predatory.)  tl;dr: Would it be a more effective visible way to protest the new ad system if we raised the prices on all of our items to $5 000?,1,30,SafelySolipsized,2020-02-28 22:24:34

The email asks for a response  stating that ‘Failure to respond to this inquiry in 24 hours may result in the suspension of your account‘.  So I reply to the email stating how this has already been resolved  and am hit with the typical “This is not a monitored inbox. Visit the Help Center for support.” I visit the help center to find nothing pertaining to my situation  and I do not have any open cases on my account or any flags on the specific purchase.  From my perspective  I’ve just been issued a request for action without any actual channel to submit action. I apologize if I am just being dense  but am I missing something here? I’ve never had this happen before  and am hoping to not have my account suspended over something that has literally already been resolved.

0.0,0.4407,"order, pay, tip, customer, money, people, good, make, service, batch",Etsy,I came across a “vintage” item that I knew was not actually vintage. I tried to take action and it backfired. What should I do if this happens again?,I have a bit of a collection of dirndls (traditional German dresses). About a year ago  I was looking to add to my collection by buying a vintage one on Etsy. And as I was browsing  I came across something odd: a listing for a dirndl I already own. Same pattern  same fabric  same brand. Exactly the same. It was listed as vintage  but I bought that dress at a German department store in 2014. It’s definitely not a vintage garment. Furthermore  even if the seller had bought it at a thrift shop and had no way of knowing it was mass-produced five years ago for a department store  it’d be obvious to anyone who knows anything about dirndls that this one is not vintage. There are a lot of rather obvious differences between a vintage and a modern dirndl. This one was unmistakably modern.  I decided to contact the seller. Maybe she didn’t know the dress was modern. I sent her a message saying “Just to let you know  I bought this exact same dress at a department store in 2014. I really have a hard time believing the dress you’re selling is vintage. You might want to look into it.” She took this as a compliment  and thanked me for letting her know that her “vintage” dirndl looked to be in such good condition. I wasn’t really sure how to respond at that point  so I didn’t.   Obviously  that was a long time ago  and the garment has since sold. But I’d like to know what to do if I ever come across something like that again. I think it’s rather fraudulent to try to pass off a 5-year-old dress as vintage  and I’d like to be able to shop for vintage items without having to worry about getting scammed. I looked on Etsy’s website to try to figure out how to report a violation of the Terms of Service  but all I could find was a written list of the rules  nothing on how to report a violation or when to report a violation. Also  I’m not even sure if reporting is the best course of action.   Have any of you ever had a situation like this? What did you do? What would you advise other Etsy shoppers to do in this situation?  Edit to add: i checked back at this seller’s shop. the seller is currently selling similar garments. I can tell from the tags and the fabric that they are less than ten years old  and I think I could find evidence for this on these brands’ websites. Should I do anything about this?,1,6,kabea26,2020-05-19 21:23:44

I tried coupon code for a month but my repeat customers all would buy without the coupon code so I got rid of that... Been having steadily growing consistent sales for a few months now.

I'm generally looking to experiment with sales. I don't plan on having sales very often. Just 2-3 times a year at most. Thought this would be a good time to try. Thinking of doing 20%.   Just wondering what everyone's experience is? Looking specifically for thoughts and opinions from shop owners with consistent daily sales.

I'm thinking about reorganizing my shop and curious what you think  either from your experience or from looking at my shop with a buyer's eye. Here's my shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/BewildernessPuzzles/  I make a few different sizes of puzzles (see my Sections  so 326-piece  50-piece etc)  and I can make basically any combination of image + size  except for some special puzzles here and there. Currently  my shop is organized so that I have a separate listing for each combination. For example  one listing for a 173-piece Raven puzzle  a separate one for a 326-piece Raven puzzle  etc.  I haven't heard any feedback from customers that they found that confusing  or that they accidentally bought the wrong puzzle  or anything like that. But I do wonder if it's turned away people I don't know about.  I'm thinking about a couple of other options for how I could do things: -Change nothing about the actual listings but put them in new Sections based on image style  difficulty  or something else. -Change listings so that I have only one image per listing  but then people could select the size/difficulty they want in a dropdown. This seems cleaner but I'm not sure if it'll negatively affect things by cutting way down on the number of listings I have. Or if there will be some other unforeseen consequence.  Any opinions or perhaps ways to do it that I haven't thought of?  Thanks!!,1,2,bewilderness_puzzles,2019-10-02 20:48:27

I am furious:  A new risk-free way to advertise  You know advertising is key to growing your shop and expanding your reach. But  you’ve told us that promoting your products across the web feels risky because you could pay for ads that don’t lead to a sale.   Today  we’re excited to announce two updates to help you increase traffic to your shop with advertising.   First  we’re introducing an expanded advertising service: Offsite Ads. We’ll pay the upfront costs to advertise your listings on multiple high-traffic sites including Facebook  Instagram  Pinterest  and Bing in addition to Google.   We’re also making some changes to Etsy Ads to put you back in control of your advertising investment. Your Etsy Ads budget  which previously went to both onsite and Google Shopping ads  will now only go toward promoting your listings on Etsy.  Here’s how Offsite Ads works: We’ll pay to promote your listings across the web. When a shopper clicks on an online ad featuring one of your listings and purchases from your shop within 30 days  you’ll pay an advertising fee on that order. You only pay an advertising fee when you make a sale. Offsite Ads is only available on Etsy—we designed it with your unique needs in mind.   Your shop is a success story—you made more than $10 000 USD in sales in the past 12 months. That means you’ll benefit most from this advertising service  so you’ll be required to participate. You’ll also get a discounted rate of 12% for the lifetime of your shop  while most sellers will pay a 15% fee.     You’ll be able to see exactly how many sales you’re getting from Offsite Ads on your new dashboard  which will be available in a few weeks  and you’ll start being charged later in April.   You can get more details about this change in the Seller Handbook and we’ll keep you posted over the next few weeks.,1,168,DeeInWV,2020-02-26 13:29:54

STRIKE!,"I have posted about this before.   I am on the brink of crying  tearing my hair out  and almost ready to take 100's (or 1000's preferably) of ETSY sellers with me to the headquarters to demand a sit down meeting in person.   **WHO WILL GO WITH ME?** If any one is serious about this  I think we should organize hundreds of sellers and show up in person to demand a meeting with the CEO or Vice President at the very least. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **As if ETSY Ads wasn't getting bad enough - it just got worse as of** ***March 1st.***   If you have your listings enrolled in Etsy Ads - you may remember the good ol' days when you could customize your price per click according to YOUR understanding of your own niche market and products.   Now? ETSY determines what product bids at what price  regardless of asking for your permission.   I adjusted to this new system in recent months. In fact  ETSY ads brought me in additional $830 in extra revenue in the Month of February alone. ***Now I""m being punished for it.***   **A) Have you poured your sweat and will power into a new product  and listed it  excited to promoted it? ALL new listings are now biding at 0.35-0.55 a click. ALMOST HALF A DOLLAR OR MORE A CLICK? Reason? They told me (upon calling)  that they have to ""test"" to see where the product belongs amonsgst the promoted listings...** ***Really? Really?***  **B) Have you had some listings perform well from being promote through ETSY ads? I have. The more your listing succeeds while promoted in ETSY Ads  the more they will rise the price on you - thus making it impossible to continue advertising it.**   **I have had to OPT OUT 5 of my listings today because they were ""Successful"" last month being promoted. As of today  my best promoted listings that were AUTO bidding at an average of about .09-.11 a click  have now** ***TRIPLED.*** **FIVE of my most successful listings through ETSY ads have shot straight up to .30-.50 a click** ***OVER NIGHT!***   **Why? Because the system deemed those Ads ""profitable""  so apparently eating up my entire budget on a few clicks for the day is some how going to help bring ETSY more money? Wrong. You see  Etsy would have made more money giving me more visibility through allowing less price per clicks  and thus collecting the  5% transaction fees on MORE sales; rather than fleecing me .55/click simply because the listing proved itself to be profitable through the ETSY ads system last February.**    Let me tell you  we all know that 90% of shoppers are window shoppers. NO one can afford a $4-$5.00 daily budget just to get a tiny little handful of clicks. ETSY sellers use to get 100's of clicks a week when we could customize our own bids. **Now  TWO CLICKS will cost you $1.00 if your listing was determined to be profitable or if its a new listing.**. ***Add that up  and a seller may pay $200-$500 a month in advertising just to have a tiny little wee handful of clicks.*** We sellers NEED the promoted listings to gain exposure while we're just starting out. They are worth it to people looking to promote their shop. They have been worth it to me. I wouldn't have had $800 in extra revenue last month had it not been for ETSY ads. But now that I have 4-5 listings that proved successful in the system from last month  they are jacking up the price 3-4X. *All that means is that my shop's viability goes DOWN  and clicks are sliced in half or more because I cannot keep raising my daily budget to compensate with Auto bids of .35-55 a click!!!*  **THE MADNESS NEEDS TO STOP!**  Who else is sick and tired of having their daily budget eaten up within a few clicks by morning??   MARCH 1st means HUGE CHANGES in ETSY Ads behind our backs. Intended to rob you of every penny you're worth.   **WHO WANTS TO GO TO THE HEADQUARTERS WITH ME TO DEMAND A MEETING with the CEO or Vice president  or whoever will listen to us??**   If anyone else is fed up with the fleecing of ETSY sellers and stealing our advertising money  please tell me. **I will set up an Event to make it happen today.**   &amp;#x200B;  Signed   A very upset ETSY Seller",1,15,Boober721,2020-03-01 22:04:15

5.0,0.3398,"action, email, send, issue, account, participate, receive, review, message, support",EtsySellers,Can a customer sue for me accusing them of violating Etsy’s extortion policy?,I run a shop on Etsy and have a customer who left me a 1-star review. The customer said the item they received wasn’t as described  but to keep this short  it was exactly as described and they admitted not having read the description. Anyway since 1-star reviews make my shop look bad I asked if they would change their review after having described to them why I thought the review was unfair/innacurate. Everything I’ve described up to this point is just for context.   So the customer left the bad review prior to reaching out to me and then after a couple messages back and forth replied and said  “... I'll be more than happy to change my review along with a full refund.”   After the customer said this I checked Etsy’s extortion policy  since this seemed like it would be against the rules. I believe what the customer said violates Etsy’s extortion policy  particularly this line of the policy: “A buyer leaves a negative review in an attempt to force the seller into providing a refund  regardless of whether or not a refund is warranted.” So the customer saying they would change the review along with a full refund seems like a violation of the Etsy extortion policy.   Here is a link to the entire extortion policy: [Extortion Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/extortion/239966959186)  After I told the customer that it was a “clear example of extortion  as stated in Etsy’s policies” and that I would report it to Etsy for review the customer got pretty upset. The customer then said they “will be reaching out to Esty and several partners of mine of your false  accusation of extortion”. (Edited quote to fix customer’s typo).   My concern here is what she means by “several partners”. Do you think she is implying that she is going to reach out to several lawyers about me ‘falsely’ accusing her of extortion? Is that even a legitimate lawsuit? And I feel like I stated clearly why it was a violation of the extortion policy. I shared the excerpt from the policy with the customer and the link to the entire policy.   I reached back out to the customer twice to see if there was a way they wanted to settle our dispute they created with Etsy about the refund. I even offered to refund the purchase and agree to disagree on everything just to end the situation. The customer hasn’t replied to any of those messages though. So I’m thinking the customer is either getting a lawyer behind the scenes to sue me for ‘falsely’ accusing her of extortion or she has just gotten over it and decided to ignore me. She also made it very clear she would never buy from Etsy again  so maybe she deleted the app and isn’t receiving notifications that I messaged her. I hope that her not answering means that the info I provided her about how she violated the policy just made her concerned to the point that she isn’t answering or deleted the app so she won’t get in any trouble with Etsy.   Do you guys think she has a legitimate case or am I just worrying about nothing?,1,4,MapsAreNeat,2020-08-05 11:27:40

I am reaching out to this community to see if anybody has had a similar experience or would have a way to solve an issue I am having with Uber right now.  I have lost an important item in an Uber ride a month ago. I contacted the driver immediately after getting outside the car and never heard from him. I tried reaching out through the app a 3-4 times in that weekend with no success.  I then used the option that say that ''I couldn't reach my driver about a lost item'' which got me in touch with Uber Support. They have been telling me they contacted the driver but he has not responded yet multiple times (like at least 20 times in the past month).  I asked them if they could take any sort of actions to help my cause  but they said the only thing they can do is wait for the driver to respond.  I have been to the Uber Greenlight office in my city twice already. Both times they told me the driver has been taking multiple courses every day since I lost my item. He has been active but just does not reply. They tried calling him a few times while I was there and he never picked up or replied to the voicemails they left.   One of the guys there said they can usually suspend the driver's account until he comes to their office or at least calls them back. Every time I go to their office  they say they will do it in the next 24 hours  but end up not doing it...  They also suggested I contact the authorities  which I did but the police officer told me they would not take any actions since it is not a criminal act from the driver's perspective.  Between this and the automated responses from their support  it is getting very frustrating and I am kind of out of options right now.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!  TLDR:  I have lost a valuable item a month ago in an Uber  reached out to the driver and support immediately and they have not been able to get in touch with him. Authorities will not do anything since it is not considered a criminal act. Is there anything else I can do?,1,9,AutumnsGrief,2019-04-27 21:55:35

As most of you know  Uber’s IPO will be coming out on the 9th. They are estimated to raise $10 BILLION DOLLARS! As drivers  we are the backbone of the company. We are the ones grinding it out everyday  taking people to the airport  hospitals  relieving the stress of people so they don’t have to drive drunk  and transporting people to their jobs. Without the one million rideshare drivers in America  this would not be possible. If all rideshare drivers were to not work for one day  it would impact over five million people needing the services.   The 25% rate cuts have been devastating to the livelihood of thousands of drivers. They are unable to feed their families  pay their bills  and many are resorting to sleeping in their cars because they cannot afford housing. While the CEO of Uber is expected to get a $50 MILLION DOLLAR bonus for the company going public  drivers are working almost twice as much to earn what they did a few months ago.   I’m hoping this May 8th strike will have a huge impact  not just on Uber  but to our passengers who support us  and we can make a change for the better.   We need to stand in solidarity and show our strength in numbers.   Please stand with me and let’s keep our apps off for one day.

I didn’t notice it at first but once we were on the freeway  he couldn’t hold a lane for crap. There were a couple times I wasn’t sure if we were going to sideswipe another vehicle.  I sat up a little higher so I could see his eyes in the rear view mirror and saw his eyes were barely open. He wasn’t looking down at his phone (which was loose; ie.  not in a mount. When I said “hey man  it’s the next exit” when he wasn’t getting over for our exit  he swerved across four lanes of traffic to make the exit.   On the one hand I know people need to make money  however horrible. On the other hand  driving tired is just as bad scientifically as driving with a few beers in your system.   I called Uber’s critical response line to explain and later got an email saying they deactivated him temporarily. Hopefully he got home safe and got some sleep.

Minimum wage is one of the few rules you set for the game and let the markets play. Without these  you should own slaves and be slaves.  From NYT  everybody can drive to make a living so the lawmakers limit the supply artificially so drivers and the city can make decent profits while pax complains a lot. It's hard to break the lawmakers.  But Uber with an unlimited supply of money broke the model  sometimes operate illegally with the support of the public. Early drivers were happy and pax were happy.  Pax are afraid that price will go up if drivers are paid more. That is narrow thinking. The market is a lot more than that. Yes  if the price goes up  some riders cannot afford it  but I won't call them crybabies. It's a market force. If drivers are being paid 40/50 cents a mile the one left won't be familiar with the US language and roads and all cars will be crappy.  And sorry for the drivers who said the strike was useless. But we may be the 1st global strike. Media couldn't have enough of it. Senators and representatives jump in to support. You can argue that Uber/Lyft reply with less cut of the fare if only temporarily. Or you can argue that they reply with reduced rates. So whether you support the strike or not  you feel the success and you feel the pain. I'll call that a success  LOL.  Uber could fail but I don't see how impossible to replace it. How difficult are local taxi dispatchers to update their phone system to give you an app with GPS? Taxies are expensive because the lawmakers want it that way. Now it's already broken so Uber isn't necessary.,1,37,fitfulbrain,2019-05-25 22:00:47

I tried filing a complaint against a driver who seemingly forced me to cancel a ride. The response from Uber was lukewarm and just told me I would be refunded my cancellation fee (which I wasn’t charged to begin with). Which would have been enough if I didn’t feel he was probably also taking advantage of many other riders.   I was in New Orleans for a weekend trip with my girlfriend. We got to bourbon street and hung out until we called an Uber to get us back to our Airbnb. I designated a pickup and as I saw him pulling up  I waved my arm to acknowledge him. The driver punches the accelerator and drives right past me. I figure maybe he made some sort of mistake or couldn’t stop because traffic. I check my map and he’s a couple blocks away. I took several screenshots after I became wary of his behavior and to cover my ass if I needed to prove I was passed over. I give him 5 or so minutes to turn around the block or contact me. I message him in the mean time telling him he drove past me. After 10-15 min I tried calling him through the app a couple times. No answer. Another few minutes and the map updated and he was just as far away but in a different location. I message again  this time a little more assertively. Another 5 minutes I decided to call again one last time. I’m immediately sent to the automated message. He blocked me. Out of fear of paying the cancellation fee  I hung on while my girlfriend ordered us another ride. Til we got home I checked my app. My driver was in the same spot the whole time. He eventually canceled the ride himself in the middle of the night 4am or so.   I’m speculating here  but I imagine this wasn’t his first time doing this. Especially with how many drunk people there are around bourbon street  I imagine many drunk people will cancel the ride after waiting for so long and possibly not think or remember about the fee. If this is the case  I don’t think this guy should continue driving. I’d like to give the benefit of the doubt to this driver  but his location not moving and blocking me from contacting him  only to eventually cancel on me several hours later makes me question his credibility.,1,21,thisxisxlife,2020-01-19 09:06:32

My first ping today (lyft of course since Uber is a dead app) was 7 min away  toward airport/downtown and off interstate.  So I declined because it was too far away  closed the gap toward common destinations and could not benefit from interstate speeds.  Lyft is not honest about time to pick up so I try to take within 5 min if possible.  Almost never take over 10  exception is it is close to a place I am headed to anyway or late overnights when that is all you get.  Closing gap trips suck because you drive for free halfway or more toward the final destination so maybe you spend 28 min on the trip for $4.  Des Moines is perfectly situated with interstates so you can favor proximate pick ups and often most or the entire trip is interstate.    Anyway  the ping got three strikes so I declined it.  3 min later I got a on interstate broaden the gap trip at a hotel. It was 8 min but I took it due to only one strike.,1,6,DSMIAGuy,2019-01-11 16:11:09

I'm not gonna side with the bs reports out there that I make less than minimum wage  and I dont think many drivers do... but I for sure dont make enough for what I do... and how much the customers pay after getting my cut.  When this rideshare convenience started back in the day  drivers were making $2 - $3 a mile  and uber planted it into the consumers head that tipping was not necessary.. yea maybe so.. when back then every ride was literally about a 2x- 3x surge cost wise according to today's rate...and drivers were being paid fairly .. oh yea and the companies were growing and throwing mad bonuses for a driver just to be online and not even complete a single ride.... for those of you not in the now.. just being online for an hr back then and not even doing a  single ride even guranteed you $20-$25 hr +.. these were the promos to build these companies that now essentially slaves work for.  Long story short  I see these protests against lyft and uber to raise there wages  it's not gonna happen.. but if we can protest about the tipping culture and how a 5 star driver can do 20 rides in a day and only recieve 2 or 3 tips... we can get the attention of the public. We rightfully so deserve more money... and if every passanger tipped min a $1 or $2... this gig can be very sustainable for many people,1,20,KingSnes21,2019-02-14 09:46:19

Both are located on the same narrow 1-way street in a historical downtown. Biker bar is pretty much self sufficient and carefree  while a cartel shithole is always monitored by at least 2 patrol cars after dark.   I'm parked next to the latter  waiting on a pax (or timer  whichever comes first)  when a dirty van with glowing Uber sign makes an illegal turn and starts driving towards me  totally ignoring the fact that the street is clearly marked as one way and he's moving in a wrong direction.   Oh boy  you must be new. I already see a blackout cop car slowly pulling from the alley behind me  ready to bust his ass… But suddenly there's a pimped up Mustang flying at least 60 in a 15mph zone  blowing a red light  not quite making it into a turn and smashing full speed into a line of parked cars.  In a matter of seconds there were 7 cop cars at the scene  cops shouting  weapons drawn  and everyone lost their interest in that Uber van. At this exact moment the van driver realized that he's driving in a wrong direction  so he slammed on the brakes and did a 16-point (I kid you not) turn  then *sloooowly* noped the fuck out  most likely to change his pants.  PS: When I drove by 20 minutes later  I saw at least 15 cop cars at the scene. Guess that Mustang was loaded.,11,6,schmuber,2019-02-23 21:50:47

Awesome. She's ready to get in my car before I even come to a full stop. So far  great.   She gets in  I confirm the name and address (grocery store). Not even a few minutes into the ride and ""Ugh  shit."" I respond ""Is everything okay?"" ""Yes  I just don't seem to have any small bills.""  I immediately understand what she's trying to say and I tell her that her showing up on time was my tip. She says it's unacceptable and that she'll figure something out and proceeds to try to tip in the app.  We start talking and have some really great conversation. Right before we get to grocery stores parking lot she gives me a twenty dollar bill(couldn't figure out the in app tipping). I didn't feel right about it seeing as I only drove her 2.1 miles. She insisted. I tell her if she refuses to take her money back that I'm going to sit in the parking lot and wait for her to come back. She hits me back with ""Then I'm just going to tip you another $20"" and shuts the door.  Not even a full 10 minutes and she's already back. I help her put her things in my trunk even after she insisted it wasn't necessary. We get back in the car and she asks me how to request uber so she gets me again. I laugh and tell her I'm taking her home for free. We continue talking and she casually slips me another $20. I insist she take it back  but she isn't having it. (Two jews arguing over NOT taking money  who would have thought?!)  She says she's blessed and that ""it feels right"" to give it to me.   ""You are something else [pax name].  Thank you""   We continue talking and she mentions how her husband had recently passed and how she's new to the city. We arrive at her apartment and I help her with her groceries. She insists that I don't have to walk all the way to her apartment but I wasn't having it.   She ends up walking me back to my car and thanks me again for my help. I tell her that she wont understand this when I tell her  but that she was a godsend for me.  She gives me a big hug and we exchange numbers.  Everything happens for a reason  sometimes you just don't know that reason. Except this time I feel like I know what it was. My neighbor's husband had passed away about 11 years ago. She is like a second mother to me and even before her husbands passing  we were very close. And after  I helped look after her three sons and did whatever I could to help out.

Long version: Went to pick up pax and he informed me that he needed to take his drunk gf home  but didn't have her new address in her new city  so he put her old address (different city) in the app and would just direct me where to go.   Informed him I couldn't do that  that I needed the destination in the app so uber could charge it correctly  etc.  He says ""I've driven for uber and you're lying. Just drive. She's drunk"". Informed him I couldn't and that he'd have to get a different driver. He tells me to shut the fuck up and drive. Told him i'm canceling the trip and he needed to get out of my car. He says he's not getting out of the car. Informed him I'll have to call the police. He tells me to go ahead. So I do.   While on the phone  on bluetooth speaker with police  his gf attempts to leave the car and he grabs her by her hair and jerks her back into the car. They start struggling over her purse. I'm giving a play by play to police  when in the rearview mirror  I see him hit her in the face. I tell the police and he yells ""she bit me!"". Didn't see the biting  but it's plausible  as they were really starting to fight. Then they just start going at it. The house nearby was having a backyard party  and I could see people  so I just started laying on the horn and thankfully  they came running. As they got to us  the police pull up and the guy jumps out of the car and says ""I got out of the car when she asked!!!"". Total lie and thankfully they could hear him over my bluetooth  so they knew better.   The next hour was me giving a police report  them bringing in an ambulance and 2 fire trucks to assess physical damage  and me on the phone with uber  reporting the issue.   As they wrap up  the gf is taken away in the ambulance and the guy is released to call another uber and go home. They did nothing to him.  Before he calls another uber  he walks over to me to yell at me that I was a fucking bitch  that I could have taken them home  that he's done 3600 drives for uber and knows the rules. Also  that I should have left as soon as he got out of the car and I just wanted to cause him trouble. The cop was standing RIGHT beside him and I ask the cop ""why is he allowed to stand here berating me?? I'm here because I had to give you a report and report this to uber. Wtf?""  Cop says ""he's not under arrest"".  That's it. Nothing else. Finally I wrap up with uber shortly after and I leave.   Wtf? Did I handle that incorrectly? Why wasn't he arrested for pulling her hair and hitting her?? Should he have been allowed to step up to me like that after the incident? Am I in the twilight zone??",9,26,SoxHeather,2019-03-18 05:41:18

I did a couple of rides around town today like normal and then got a request for a 45+ minute ride. It’s the end of the semester so I figured I’d be giving a ride to Indianapolis airport. Boy was I wrong. Picked up the pax  a freshman girl from the dorms  and when I start the ride it shows me she’s going to Cincinnati  a 2.5 hour drive away.   Eh I don’t have anything to do for the rest of the day so I figured why the hell not. As we get going I ask if she has a preference on music  she doesn’t  so I put on my classic rock station. I start driving and attempt to make conversation but it’s clear she’s not interested. That was my first bad impression.   Side note: for anyone not familiar with the area there’s only one way to go to Cincinnati from Bloomington. You go to Columbus first  then greensburg  then get on I-74 the rest of the way. This was the way my Uber app took me (this will be important later)  Along the way we hit construction traffic on I-74 slowed us down maybe 15-20 minutes. We made passing comments about the traffic and how it sucks. Eventually I see what’s slowing everyone down. There was a semi flipped on its side on the side of the road and everyone was slowing down to look as they passed. Eventually got through it and got her to her destination. As we pull up and she’s about to get out she says thank you so much for the ride I really appreciate you driving me this far.   Ride ends and I see I got $160 fare from the ride and then it pops up that she tipped me $30 wohoo!!  I think that’s the end but then I notice my rating has dropped down from a 4.98 to 4.96 (I don’t care about my rating as long as its above 4.9). I click on the details and see the elusive two star rating and a report for “trip route”. Wtf I think to myself. How are you going to complain about the route after I was just following the app  you didn’t mention anything as I was driving  and you thank me after we get there.   Anyway  that’s my rant over.

Drive  don’t drive  no one cares!,This post is in response to the other posts on here that are talking shit about the strike on May 8th.    We already know that it’s not going to be a meltdown for either Uber or Lyft. That is not the expectation. People will still drive and people will still ride. The main thing to note about the strike is that it is a sign that drivers are getting more and more fed up. The media has been reporting on the strike and so the message is getting out there. In my book  this makes the strike a success already. It will take many more strikes for change to happen  to get the attention of the people in power and pressure them into doing the right thing.   Some riders may choose an alternative mode of transport in support of drivers. We’ll never truly know either way. But it is very encouraging to see drivers show some self respect and a willingness to fight back in some small way against the Goliath of Uber and Lyft by staying home that day. Extra credit for those who will join in the picket lines to help create even more awareness.    So if you choose to drive because you have no self respect  or you expect to rake in the dough due to surge (won’t happen!) or if you genuinely need the income and can’t afford to miss a day  it’s all good. This is bigger than any one of us.,20,15,SFUber,2019-05-07 18:58:05

3.0,0.366,"strike, driver, make, day, work, today, protest, company, people, app",uberdrivers,Why and why not strike with vengeance ON our greedy boss? IPO? HELL NO!!,My name is Izzy I drive for uber for 4 years.  I rely on driving to pay rent  buy food and just survive.   .   When I first started with uber I was working 60 hours a week which is still a lot but I was averaging 2k a week. Now I'll be lucky if I get 1000 for the same work and time.   .    Every year everything goes up in prices rent  insurance  gas   food and uber rates keep decreasing making us work more and more to satisfy their greedy business model.  They want us to help them reach their main goal which is to look good for their IPOs so they can make 120 billion overnight by forcing us to work long hours by making small inexpensive trips to help them gain market share. Uber also makes more money on short trips because they double dip by taking the initial rider's fee and half of the minimum fare fee.   .    All they really care about is market share  how much they can squeeze out of cheap labor  with no overhead costs on their end of the spectrum. OUR expenses.. Our time and hard working backs so they can in turn look good for their IPO and make billions.   ·      We’re totally at the mercy of these companies. Few weeks ago overnight Uber cut drivers rates by 25% in LA – with no input from drivers. They are only paying us 60 cents a mile. Before it was 79 cents per mile which was still super low poverty level considering we are running our vehicles to the ground rather quickly.. 2-3 years. Not factoring  gas which also went up a whopping 20% since the cut and still going up.   They decrease the mileage to force us to do short trips all day. They arguing we would get bonuses.  Bonuses are ridiculously low.. About 1 dollar extra per ride after 70 to 100 rides.. Barely even paying for gas.   ·      My landlord isn’t going to cut rent by 25%  which means I need to drive longer hours and I already drive 50+ hours a week.   People think that gig workers are doing this on the side or for extra money  when it’s really something thousands of people rely on for their primary income.   ·      At the LAX lot  I see drivers who are immigrants  people with disabilities  elderly people who can’t afford to retire – really vulnerable workers who are working without a safety net.   On busy days at the airport such Thursday to Mondays evenings.  Uber Drivers have to wait on queue between 30 to 40 minutes to get one a ping request.  It takes approximately 18 to 25 minutes to get to their terminal due to traffic from the uber holding waiting lot  and 10 to 15 min to drive off the airport.  After about 2 hour to successfully lock in a ride.   We have to pray and hope that this ride takes us more than 20 miles to be even slightly profitable.   If they are less than 10 miles in which we would be only making $10 dollars as per uber guaranteed minimum pick up rates at the airport.  About 30 to 50% of those pings are shorts.. So drivers only makes $10 after that long wait without factoring gas/overheads. 80% riders don't even tip due to Uber old mentality. Uber knows all of these things and they don't care.. It's about making the user's / riders happy and  creating a dominant market share to look good for their IPO so they can make billions on the driver's hard backs. If uber don't care about the drivers.. Drivers will care less about uber and riders.   Taxi cabs don’t leave the airport with less than $40 dollars guaranteed even if they are going less than one mile            WE are constantly being monitored and supervised by the Uber app. They want us to be contractors but they can easily cut the rates overnight without us having a say.  They obligate us to accept all of these terms they throw at us or else we can’t go online and work.  We can get deactivated (FIRED) if we call customers to find out where they are going.   Sometimes it’s not profitable to go to certain areas especially if that might send you far because that means you have to drive back empty.  (Deadheaded) There is no transparency.  They want us to work like slaves.  They say they care but they really don’t.  They like to make the riders/ customers happy but they treat us like modern day slave robots. ·      Uber  Lyft  etc. know how vulnerable drivers are and they exploit that.  ·      Every driver knows someone who was deactivated for a minor problem or misunderstanding.  ·      Deactivation means your income is gone  and  if you’re leasing from the company  your car is too.  ·      The companies don’t care; they know they can just replace you with someone else. They hire new drivers about 300 daily saturating the market more and more.. They make more money from us on small short rides due to their booking fees thus making 45% every single time.   ·      That’s their business model  make drivers disposable  get people hooked on cheap rides and take over the market.  ·      Now  with these IPOs coming up  it’s only going to get worse. I’m afraid they will keep cutting the rates even more. ·      Uber and Lyft’s Silicon Valley workers are going to make billions overnight with the promise that they become profitable for investors. ·      They’ve never made a profit yet and they already treat us as disposable. What’s going to happen next? ·      All of these drivers are giving their lives to billion dollar companies and they deserve the same rights as any other employee. 1. Huge risk. You are constantly on the busiest road with the most aggressive drivers in the nation. So many things can go wrong  Personal injury or even death  Property damage  handicapped for rest of your life  Financial ruined for rest of your life  Insurance hike  falsely deactivation  Random rate cut and more.   2. Zero Benefits. No health insurance  no sick leave  no paid vacation  no 401K  no social security  the list goes on.  3. Not everyone is cut out to be a rideshare drivers. Those with terrible driving records and criminal records are out  Those who are afraid of risks are out. Those bad at navigating  lack of interpersonal skills soon will be eliminated by the 4.6 rating barrier.  4. While almost everyone has a car  Drivers are not getting compensated a single penny running their relatively expensive tool (comparing to other jobs) into the ground. A reliable used car run about $10 000  Now imagine the company you work for tell you that you have to discard $10 000 worth of property every 3-5 years   NYC got regulated.. San Francisco..   They are now making decent wages more than twice of LA prices maybe even triple.   Why?  They got together and fought back.. Are you going to fight back?   Everyone needs to participate on this next stike make copies I would say 100 each at least and give it out to everyone you see on the street   The only way we can stop these companies exploitation of modern day slave work is for us to dissimnate  unite and fight back.      I care about these drivers  I see them every day and I fight for them on the airport lot  and I’m fighting for them here. I hope this unify us and make them feel our pain..  All we want is fair pay  dignity and respect.  “If enough drivers participate  they will have an impact ” says NYU business professor Arun Sundararajan  who is generally bullish on the prospects for Uber  Lyft  and other “gig-economy” companies. “Worker protests by Uber and Lyft drivers get far more attention than any other labor action in the world right now.”,3,30,Rev2k18,2019-05-08 12:34:47

3.0,0.3465,"strike, driver, make, day, work, today, protest, company, people, app",uberdrivers,LA Strike Observation,First off  I am driving today. I wish I could afford to not and strike but the reality is I can’t. Sorry. You can side eye me or ignore this post from here if it upsets you.   That being said  as I had suspected this strike wasn’t very effective in terms of disruption. I saw some protestors at the airport. The waiting lot was pretty desolate but I’ve seen it like that on other days too.   I am not sure if LA just wasn’t very effective in getting the word out — I only heard about it because someone scrawled it in sharpie on the port-a-potty at the airport lot on Monday. I wasn’t even sure if it was old graffiti and was referring to last May 8.   Today driving was pretty much the same as any other day. There weren’t any crazy surges because of lack of drivers. The passengers I talked to had no trouble getting a ride. It was pretty much a normal day.   The other thing that I think is missing is a clear agenda. I am all for workers’ rights and I am upset at the rate cuts and how shitty they treat us drivers but I don’t know if there is a clear set of demands.   Yes  more pay. Great. But in return for what? I keep seeing the main argument against this by drivers on here being that getting employee status will upend the flexibility and control of our job. I started driving because of the ability to create my own schedule. Of course that has meant having to fit in more and more hours just to make enough to hit my nut.   I posed this question to this forum a while back  but I think creating a rideshare guild (or gig economy guild) would be a better solution. It would be like the entertainment guilds that protect workers’ rights but also maintain the freelance contractor status.   Lastly  I think if we were to organize a strike  we need to be more disruptive. I was reminded of the protests that shut down the airport when trump first announced the travel ban. I think it would be a much more powerful act if drivers united and planned a caravan that shut down LAX for a few hours. Have a clear list of demands and make a real impact. It wouldn’t be about arguing with each other about who’s a scab or a shill or a fool amongst ourselves. If I saw an endless caravan of drivers slowly circling the terminal from Century to Sepulveda  making it impossible for riders and drivers to connect at the airport and making our voices heard  I would definitely join the parade.   But waving signs on the side of the road and yelling seems pretty ineffective ultimately. The last strike came and went. Uber went public anyway. Uber kept the wages shitty.   Just my thoughts. Go ahead and blast me if you feel the need. Thanks for reading.,5,6,the101tothe110,2019-05-08 20:28:43

3.0,0.3512,"strike, driver, make, day, work, today, protest, company, people, app",uberdrivers,I was at the L.A. Strike against Uber today and I was disappointed in many of the drivers there. Before you just flippantly downvote this  at least read the rest of the post to see why I was disappointed., I hope the L.A. Strike is doing some damage to the company  I sincerely do  but I was there earlier and I was pretty disappointed in so many drivers.   I saw striking drivers harassing other drivers who probably didn't even know a strike was taking place. I saw a guy throw an empty coffee cup at a passing Uber car. I saw many thumbs down  people booing passing Uber cars  and lots of people flipping other drivers off.  I don't think it's productive to alienate other drivers  especially without knowing their situation. Many drivers drive for Lyft and Uber together  and none of the harassing drivers knew whether the other drivers were driving a Lyft passenger where the Uber app is obviously off. I though that was the idea: Keep the Uber app off... at least the picket signs said so.,20,45,Ally-Samm,2019-05-08 23:18:30

On the driver side  another dude gets in the car and says that HE is Pete  and tells other dudes to gtfo of his Uber. The other dude doesn’t stop getting in the back  so the real Pete decides to lay hands on the imposter Pete  who swings back.   Now real Pete is really pissed and leaps out of the car and tries to take on both older Petes and bedlam ensues. Meanwhile  both of my passenger side doors are open now. I run around  close both doors  and jump in and cancel the ride (Rider behavior) and haul ass out of there. Got a $3.75 cancel fee for it.   Get to the next traffic light  decide to look in the back seat  and lo and behold  real Pete has left his phone. I figured the fight had to have ended by then  so I turn around and head back. Real Pete is now standing in the parking lot not far from the imposter Petes  with no shirt on he was wearing an Astros jersey in Philly for some reason).   When I pull up  he says “you don’t have to take me anywhere  but can I at least have my phone back?” I say  where’s your Astros jersey  since I didn’t get a good look at what his face looked like. He holds it up and I hand him the phone back. Then I reported to Uber that I returned an item to a rider and got $15 on top of it.   Grand total: $18.75. Miles traveled: Zero.

I ask because too many drivers don't seem to grasp the concept of a work day as opposed to just a day. More in description...",Ok  so I was recently talking to some guys at the airport while taking a break  and they were all comparing appendage sizes by quoting how much they make in a day. $250  $300  were just average numbers  so I got curious  because their numbers differed from my own numbers  and I thought I was doing things very wrong.   Many drivers there  and even here  seem to think that when they post that they made $350 in a day  they're making $350/day. That's not how labor is calculated though. What a lot of these drivers forget to factor is the hours it took to make that $350. The drivers I spoke to at the airport were showing me $350 income since morning  but what they weren't saying is that they'd been awake since 4:00am  and it was now 9:00pm! They worked 17 hours to earn that $350!   I feel like some people are seeing these great numbers and potential for income  and they think drivers are making this kind of income in 8 typical working hours like a normal 9-5 job.  I bust my butt and am lucky to make anything over $20/hr  out of which I still have to take out daily expenses like gas  not to mention monthly expenses like car payments and insurance  and yearly expenses like tires  oil changes and car washes. So don't start thinking we're living the drug dealer's lifestyle  because it takes a lot of hours to make that $350.,13,79,Ally-Samm,2019-06-28 03:59:28

They told me that the average payout for arbitration was around 11-17 cents per mile and they anticipate the class action paying out at around 30 cents per mile. I had a friend pursue arbitration and receive a pretty decent settlement of around $1 500 (I say decent because most people are getting a few bucks for all of the previous class actions).   &amp;#x200B;  This raised some questions for me as I know if I switch to Class Action  I will lose my right to pursue arbitration - please let me know your thoughts based on my comments below:  1.)  I asked how many drivers were involved in the class action and they told me they did not have that information after dodging the question by telling me payout was based on mileage. I told them it reeks of incompetence that they don't even know how many people they are representing... They still refused to give me that information.  2.) They told me the attorneys are only keeping 40% and the drivers 60%. That sounds like an odd split for a case like this.  3.) They told me the payout is $20 million. Any information I can find online indicates that back in 2016 around 13 500 drivers were involved in the class.  4.) I see from recent articles that Uber is scrambling over the arbitration suits as around 60k drivers have filed and it would cost them nearly $600 million to pursue those... Meanwhile class actions are only costing around $20-40m.   5.) I find it funny that for the SAME case  the judge in 2016 threw out Uber's proposed $100m settlement because he was outraged at how low it was  and now they are accepting the payout of $20m....  (this sounds like somebody was bribed)  6.) They told me they should have my money by the end of the year (even though I didn't ask) as if this was some sort of incentive to switch over... They mentioned arbitration could take 1 or 2 years. Why are they pushing this so hard if the size of the class is going to have no impact on the settlement?     Is it just me or does this all seem like a conspiracy to me? The judge rejects the $100m settlement  and in the end it's reduced to $20m. This works out for Uber. The lawyers are now pushing arbitration suits to become a part of the class action as Uber is bleeding money from arbitration. This works out for Uber. Everything points to Uber being in control of both sides. It almost seems like the law firms are being compensated additionally (by Uber) for every driver they can move over to the Class... There is NO way I did not sign a forced arbitration deal and I definitely never opted out. It all seems incredibly dubious.  Every moment in history that has LOOKED like a WIN for drivers only pans out to be an absolute and total loss. No attorney that was going to accept a $100m payout would instead settle for $20m later on would they? Unless they were getting some kickback behind the scenes?   Or am I just crazy? Let me know if you think I should join the class or stay in arbitration.,1,13,wrexf0rd,2019-08-15 20:38:02

One was a restaurant and one was a grocery store.   At the first stop  waited over 5 mins  nothing from the pax so I ended the trip and left. I knew on a Saturday  there was no way it was going to take less than 5 mins.   Few minutes later  I get a couple calls. Didn’t answer as my next pax was about to get in. But I assumed maybe previous pax left something. Sure enough  there was a bag in the back seat. I grab it and put somewhere safe and finish my next ride.   As soon as the next ride is over  I listen to the vm  it’s the pax asking about the left behind bag. I log out and reach out to uber and let them know I have it and wait for a call from pax.   15 mins later I get the call  I explain that we normally don’t wait over 5 mins unless an agreement is made beforehand. He tells me the driver who got him after I left looked my info up and Facebook and gave it to him. WTF. Anyways  I return the stuff  and he tipped me $10 so I decided not to report the return of the item so he doesn’t get charged the fee.   I post on my local group about this and sure enough  the doucher who DOXed me to the pax speaks up and says he would and will do it again.   Fuck that. Our information is kept private for a reason. Uber/lyft give us tools to be able to rectify previous issues without having to give out our own personal information. I’m always fair with my pax  would never fuck them over and def would never keep their shit. I don’t need some doucher sending my info to some pax who might be irate over nothing and coming to find me.     I reported the guy to our groups admin and let them know about it.

2.0,0.3909,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",uberdrivers,I'm being sued by an Uber Driver who ran a red light,Around 18 months ago  I was driving with Lyft when I was involved in a collision with an Uber driver who ran a red-light (we were both mid-ride and had passengers at the time of the accident.) There were no witnesses (no dashcam/street cameras  1 in the morning and both passengers were on their phone.) My car was totaled and my personal car insurance provider didn't cover me because I was using my car for business. That's fine though because Lyft's own insurance had me covered. We both said the other party was at fault and ended up paying the insurance deductibles; Uber's deductible is $1000  while Lyft's is a wallet-busting$2500.   I reluctantly  paid up the $2500  and Lyft's Insurance covered everything. After everything was settled  I went out to buy another car and a dashcam  and thought that was the end of it.  Fast forward to this week  I receive a letter saying I am being sued for $10 000 in small claims court in California. The Uber driver claims I owe him 10 grand for bodily injury  pain and suffering  and emotional distress because according to him  I failed to stop for a designated red-light. The letter also makes it very clear that I can talk to a lawyer before or after my case  but I cannot have one represent me in court.

As I start driving he took of his face mask  I asked him if he can leave his face mask on and explained that this is Uber’s requirement etc... he got an attitude and a minute after he said “well  the car smells like weed” I told him that I don’t smoke weed and i honestly can’t smell any weed  and if he happen to smell anything it might be coming from outside the car since all the windows are open. He kept giving me an attitude  I turned around and dropped him off at the same location I picked him up from  and canceled the ride for rider behavior. 10 minutes after that I got a notification from Uber saying that my account is on temp hold for investigation. After seeing this I drove to an urgent care near by and got a drug and alcohol test  the test cost was $115. I sent Uber the results and explained my side of the event. My account is still on hold. I’m thinking about suing the passenger or Uber for lost wages and the cost of the tests. Any info would help. This is in California. Thanks in advance!,1,63,JordanKay90,2020-08-06 20:23:37

2.0,0.525,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",lyftdrivers,Let me tell you about the fight that broke out while I'm waiting for a PAX,"My first passenger was cool. I picked her up in VB and took her to Norfolk. She seemed to really like my music  singing along with several songs  and was polite and pretty cheerful.     My second passengers were an older couple who I'm assuming had a nice night in Downtown Norfolk. They were quite inebriated--no judgement--so much so that they couldn't figure out how to buckle the seatbelts. I kid you not. I pulled over to the side of the road as they struggled with them and was told ""just go already"" after a minute or two in a frustrated voice.     My third passenger reeked of cigarette smoke (or maybe Mary Jane  it was really a heavy and odd smoke smell). I wouldn't have cared but I'm allergic to cigarette smoke. At one point  he asks for water and as I start to tell him there's water in the seat pocket in front of him  he tells me angrily that he's ""on the phone"" and to ""STFU"" He talked on FaceTime the whole ride and didn't even say hello or goodbye. Oh  but did tell his friends I was a cool driver as I was getting ready to drop him off.      Passenger number four was really nice and wanted to stop to pick up pizza. At the time  I didn't realize that I wouldn't get paid for waiting so I said  sure  that's not a problem at all.      However  it was while he was inside the pizzeria that a fight broke out.     So  this group of four people come out of either a local bar or the pizza shop and one woman is screaming and hollering something fierce at  I'm assuming  some guy. They stop behind my car. She's accusing him of something and the next thing I know  there' about a dozen people shoving each other and posturing behind my car.     At this point  I'm well into my anti-anxiety routine because I'm uncomfortable. Like super uncomfortable. Having survived a physically abusive father  I get triggered really easily when people raise their voices in anger.      Next thing I know  one of them goes up to the car beside me  takes off his jacket  and opens the passenger side door to stow it because he's about to throw down. He's screaming about how he's going to do some serious damage to some other guy's face. His date gets in-between him and his target and hustles him over to his driver's side door. She tries to get him into the car.     While she's doing this  he's struggling to push her away and she's thumping my car with his car door pretty hard. He tells her to stop  she's going to ruin my car to which she replies  ""I don't give a fuck about this bitch's car. Fuck this bitch.""     So I roll down my window and politely ask her to stop fucking up my car. And that's when things went sideways.     She wheels on me  screaming  hurling insults and the woman who started the whole thing appears out of like no where and starts screeching at me. I try to tell her it's not her business and she literally lunges at me  trying to climb in the window and  I can only assume  drag me out of my car.     Thankfully  someone grabs her around the waist and restrains her just enough that her two inch acrylics whiff within an eighth of an inch of my face. She's screaming ""get the fuck out of here!"" repeatedly and threatening to beat the shit out of me.     Meanwhile  I've already got the car in reverse but the main group of the fight is standing practically pressed up against my bumper.     I am a veteran. When I was in training school  I was one of the kids that marched the classes to the school house. I used to call cadence. My classmates used to ""affectionately"" call me the human megaphone. At one point  the TI's told me they could hear my cadence echo from the school house at the end of the troop walk  situated at the bottom of a hill. I just checked  and where CQ is  the schoolhouse is about three quarters of a mile away.     In short  I can be really fucking loud if I want to be.     So without even thinking about it  I belt out  ""Then get the fuck up out of my way!"" at the top of my lungs.  Needless to say  they got out of the way.  I move my car--because I'm not abandoning my passenger--to a different space. And just as I'm parking my car  the cops show up  the whole fight breaks up  people scatter  and it was over.     I don't think driving Lyft is a good idea anymore. Maybe I'm over reacting but this week has been filled with mostly brusque passengers  terrible fairs paying almost nothing  and very few rides. Most don't even acknowledge me with a hello or even say goodbye. One verbally abused me  calling me a ""stupid bitch"" when I asked if there was a specific mall entrance they'd like to be dropped off at.     So I guess if you've read this far  am I over reacting? Should I throw in the towel? I need the extra income but I'm not sure it's worth it. Then again  I do a google search and scores of ""Lyft Driver attacked by passenger(s)"" stories show up.",1,22,Scrivenerofmyth,2019-01-13 21:38:58

Have you racked up 10 000 rides? Have a 4.9 or 5 rating?... guess what  Tom a brand new driver tommorow will start tommorow and earn exactly as much as you do after u been doing this for 2 years... go ahead and quit.. theres 10 more Tom's that's will replace you.  We as drivers deserve more pay... WITH OUT A DOUBT.. but lyft and uber ain't gonna increase the per mile rate... not now  not tomorrow  not a year from now.  I'm not gonna side with the bs reports out there that I make less than minimum wage  and I dont think many drivers do... but I for sure dont make enough for what I do... and how much the customers pay after getting my cut.  When this rideshare convenience started back in the day  drivers were making $2 - $3 a mile  and uber planted it into the consumers head that tipping was not necessary.. yea maybe so.. when back then every ride was literally about a 2x- 3x surge cost wise according to today's rate...and drivers were being paid fairly .. oh yea and the companies were growing and throwing mad bonuses for a driver just to be online and not even complete a single ride.... for those of you not in the now.. just being online for an hr back then and not even doing a  single ride even guranteed you $20-$25 hr +.. these were the promos to build these companies that now essentially slaves work for.  Long story short  I see these protests against lyft and uber to raise there wages  it's not gonna happen.. but if we can protest about the tipping culture and how a 5 star driver can do 20 rides in a day and only recieve 2 or 3 tips... we can get the attention of the public. We rightfully so deserve more money... and if every passanger tipped min a $1 or $2... this gig can be very sustainable for many people,1,17,KingSnes21,2019-02-14 09:42:51

2.0,0.3711,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",lyftdrivers,It feels like I've joined Lyft at the worst possible time..,"..after reading some top posts from months and years ago  it appears Lyft has taken a nose dive in terms of payouts and bonuses/PT.   First week I had 85 rides  which I thought was great  almost $600. Then I see a post where someone was making close to $8 for driving Pax 0.8 miles and had nearly three times the amount for the same hours.   Second week I'm back at it  this time I only get 64 rides. Primetime was still active at this point so it made up for the dropoff in rides given.   I'm in my third week now and it feels like I hit a wall in terms of how much I can really earn without destroying my car. The 5 ride streak for $10 is shit. I've now had three straight days where my 4th trip is nowhere near me and you can't deny it or the streak ends. On one day  I had an obese woman request a ride(4th in the streak) and she didn't know how to set a return trip  pretty easy. Then she says she's on a fixed income and needs to know how much the ride is...idk I tell her. We then proceed to take over an hour to go from her destination and back  to buy smokes from a nearby reservation.  After entering the store  she comes back out and says she has to go the bathroom  I say ""ok..?""...she then goes over to the bushes next to the entrance and pisses. All told I was paid $23 for over an over trip during rush hour in my city.    I've put 2300 miles on my car in three weeks. I just can't see how this is all worth the hassle  unless you don't care about the wear and tear all of this does on your car(and your body).   I'd like to hear of some possible tips from drivers who have had a longer experience and possibly have better techniques to avoid rides and days like those in the future.",33,50,315MhmmFruitBarrels,2019-05-04 18:18:14

If anything  what SOME of the drivers are doing is PROTESTING what they deem as unfair treatment.   Also- calling some driver a ""scab"" for driving when some basically anonymous group of people starting telling us ""we need to strike"" is totally ridiculous. Scabs are a thing but to be one  you need to cross a picket line or defy a union you are not a part of-- and the last time I checked  there is no union (and likely never will be) of any significant size to speak of.   I just wish people would stop with this talk of strikes. Call these activities what they are and what the results lead to-- a simple protest.

I've said this to many people  you want to get Uber and Lyft to actually hear you and make changes there's only 2 ways:  Way 1 - Somehow convince every Uber/Lyft driver to stop accepting rides for 1 hour at the very same time. This will put a panicked shiver down the CEO's back quickly! However  the odds of actually getting this done are astronomically high. I think you'd actually stand a far better chance at winning all lottery games in the country at the same time than getting this accomplished.   Way 2 - Build a block of drivers  roughly 20%  as a verified block of owners. Then designate a representative to meet with the CEO's. If they don't then embargo the platform with 20% of drivers signing off for just 1 hour. They'll get the message and will be more willing to meet.  Also stop with this minimum wage shit  I'm not a fucking employee. I own my business and you should too. Keep it realistic  drivers get 80% of the fee  the tax is on the platform side which means the pax pays it separate of the fee.

2.0,0.3549,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",lyftdrivers,You don’t have to march down the street to protest lyft’s BS. Here are actual things you can do that send a better message.,1. If it’s busy and you’re not getting a decent surge or power zone  don’t take lyft rides. Turn the app off and turn Uber on. Lyft wants to keep the surge  that’s fine. But I’m going to drive for whatever platform that actually pays me for when it’s busy.   2. Cancel and no show the SECOND the timer runs out. Lyft is now stingy with cancellation fees. Make sure you’re stingy too. If the ride isn’t STARTED by the time the timer runs out  collect your 5 dollars. They give us no leeway when we drive to a destination that we can’t get to so you don’t owe anyone the courtesy to wait longer than you have to. And who cares if someone parks themselves in your car while they’re waiting on the rest of the group. The ride starts when you put your car in drive. Someone plopping in the backseat while the rest of the group gets their shit together changes nothing.   3. If there’s a ride going to the middle of nowhere or an otherwise unfavorable destination  CANCEL. Yes you can. We are independent contractors. You don’t HAVE to take a ride that you’ll lose money on. I cancel at least 7 or 8 rides a night and I have 4000 rides. I get warnings all the time but I’ve never been deactivated. Also how often do you see people on this sub actually get deactivated for cancelling? I can’t think of any.   4. Stop rating every passenger with a heartbeat 5 stars. Rate them on how economically efficient the ride was. That’s literally the only thing you should care about. Did you have to wait long for them? Did you have to take time to clean up after them? Did they demand stops? Did they tip? Did they take a ride going to the middle of nowhere? If the ride wasn’t economically efficient  rate them low and get them out of your customer pool and warn other drivers.   5. Frustrated that Lyft doesn’t pay fairly for wait time during stops? Don’t do them. “Sorry I don’t do stops.” Is a thing you’re allowed to say. Practice it in the mirror if you need to.   Posters will never change lyfts policies. Incentives will. They have no incentive to make thing better if drivers just accept the bullshit they’re getting. In my market   very few drivers will take airport trips early in the morning because it doesn’t pay enough to make them worth the drive there and back. (Denver airport is in the middle of nowhere and flights don’t start coming in till 7ish). Sooner or later  they’re going to realize that they can’t trick us to take rides that aren’t profitable.,7,24,Kelly1307,2019-06-14 10:58:42

Drop off the first passenger at 12:30am. Lyft then added a ride without informing me  but it was just 3 minutes away so I thought  okay I'll do it. Pickup the passenger  then as I'm driving I look at how far the drop off was. Lyft never mentioned it was a long ride before pickup. 93 miles away in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I only had 30 miles to empty. Nearest gas station  40 miles.   Ran on 0 miles remaining for 7 miles. Passenger was great and super grateful anyone picked him up because he was stranded at an airport.   Total pay  $57  including $4 in tolls. Dropped him off at 2:30am and headed home  an almost two hour trip  plus I had to pay the toll again. Get home at 4:30am.   Screw emailing Lyft. I'm calling and going full attorney prick mode.

So a homeless guy was flying on his bike through traffic and ran into my car while I had a passenger with me  the guy is fine but my car is not. Since I had a passenger  I did report this incident to Lyft so what they did is deactivated me until I get my car fixed  so I had a call from their insurance informing me they will fix it  but I have to pay $2500 deductibles  that is insane  I can not afford to pay that  so I asked the adjuster what is my options and she said if you did let your insurance company know that you are doing ride share from the beginning maybe you should let your insurance company handle the claim  so I did gave them a call since I informed them from the start that this car is my source of income  now my insurance company said that since I was doing Lyft I should have them handle the claim because my policy is not showing that you are doing ride share on this car i was not happy with that so I did visit my local agent and told her that I did inform you that I am doing Lyft why it’s not showing that  and she did pull my records on her system and she went  I don’t know why it’s not showing that maybe the agent when he/she created your record forgot to do so  but it shows your that your job description is Lyft driver so probably she/he must forgot to adjust an option later on. She was really nice enough to make a few phone calls to see what she can do. Long story short I had a call 2 days after from my insurance company saying because you were doing Lyft at the time of this incident happened you should pursue the claim with them  but because you are our loyal customer we will pay you the difference of the deductibles  I thought this so nice of them to help me out  little that I know when I called Lyft insurance that I want them to handle the claim and fix my car  I asked her about a rental and loss wages and she told me  hey  Lyft does not cover that sorry. At this point  I was devastated  I was without work for 8 days  I have a lot of bills coming and I can not afford that.   So my question if you were in my shoes what did you do?

After waiting over a month for city attorneys and the California Attorney General to enforce the law against Uber and Lyft and to protect the rights of workers  Rideshare Drivers United is calling for the People’s Enforcement of California employment laws.  Uber and Lyft are using the money we make driving for them to try to exclude themselves from the law—specifically from AB5. They are spending millions of dollars collecting signatures (and paying $7 per signature) to get a law on the ballot to guarantee our low pay and insecure working conditions.  Our members have researched and taught ourselves how to file DLSE (Division of Labor Standard Enforcement) claims to begin enforcing our rights and to show the real amount of money we should have been paid. Drivers have been working and earning for thousands of dollars less than what they would be if they were employees  paid a decent wage with mileage reimbursement.  The companies are claiming their ballot initiative is to protect driver flexibility. THAT IS A LIE. They are spending our hard-earned money to protect their power and their flexibility  not ours.  Join Us on Feb. 5th  Join Rideshare Drivers United as we gather outside the LA Labor Commission Office- 320 W 4th St. Los Angeles  CA 90013 to enforce our rights as employees in the state of California!

I check passenger ratings just to get a sense of what they mean  so I can set some boundaries in the future  but I don't yet refuse a low rating.  Picked up a passenger at a music venue the other evening. Bonus was around $10  which sadly affected my judgment.  Warning signs:  * There's a designated rideshare pickup area. She was instead on a street corner up the street  in a no-stopping zone along with a couple of cops threatening to give anyone picking up passengers a nice ticket * So I call her  telling her ""Are you at the corner of X and Y? Okay: stay there  and I'll come get you."" * I stop at the corner  with the cops busy a few yards up the street  figuring she'll get in - my car is of a unique and loud color - you can't miss it * I hit ""Arrive"" and 2 minutes elapse - soon a cop is banging on my passenger window  gesturing and mouthing ""get out of here"" * I put the vehicle in gear and am about to drive away  when my genius passenger  who has been standing on the curb right next to my vehicle for 2 minutes  opens the door  saying ""Oh.""  We have a real winner here.  But wait: There's more!  In steps the Angry Boyfriend: an 8-year-old in a 25-year-old body. For the entire ride  he berates her  in not-entirely-coherent terms: ""And the next time I hear from Zoe that you were talking about her behind \[insert random millennial name here\]'s back about Shadrah saying I was ... ""  including threats to get her fired from her job - there seems to be some power dynamic  such as his parents own the company which employs her. Wow. He belches abuse at her for the entire 16-minute ride - loud berating  not yelling.  Best guess: She is flake  boyfriend is abusive douche  she should dump him  and I should have dumped both of them by the side of the road.  Result: $10 fare plus $16 bonus for an 11-mile  15-minute ride (with 4 minutes of initial bedlam finding the rider  plus police anger - never a good thing).  In future  if it's a venue and they're not in the pick-up area  they have poor life skills  so I'll wait in the designated pick-up area  get my $5 if they don't show up  then leave. The $16 bonus clouded my judgment here.  Much to my regret  I did not ding this passenger's rating - and I don't recall her rating before I picked her up.  Two questions:  * I've decided to begin down-rating certain passengers. Based on what I've described  does a ""2"" seem about right? I reserve ""1"" for actual vomiting or damage to the vehicle  but am I being too lenient? * About halfway into the ride  and into his uninterrupted stream of invective  I begin to ponder the idea of ending the ride.

STRIKE!!,okay so.. i have been driving lyft part time for about a year or two. after work. i decided to switch jobs and in the few months in between i decided i’d roll with lyft to make some extra cash and bridge the gap. i have a 2014 accord v6 with leather seats and 27k miles. i decided i really didn’t wanna mess up my car or add more miles  a trend which i saw being perpetuated quickly once i started driving five 8-10 hour days a week.. so i rented an express drive vehicle. my friend has had one for over a year and it was working well for him..... until they recently dropped the rates AGAIN and i showed him this math  so here is the math.. an express driver makes .4125 per mile in the ATL market  and this is mainly how you make your money. i would say on average i drive 150 miles (in rides) daily. a non express driver  using your own car  makes .6075. a 19.5 cent difference. let’s say you drive five days at 150 miles in rides daily. you lose $29.50 per day.. times five 147.50.. times four weeks in a month. $590  now the rental car with tax is 243.09 weekly.. and you can have fun struggling to get you 95 rides (funny how every week they LEGIT throttle my rides to a crawl on Sunday if i’m only a few short). you get $55 @ 65 rides..$60 at 80.. and $60 @ 95.. leaving you to pay 68.09 a week for the rental. this times four weeks equals 272.36 you are paying monthly for this car if you hit the 95 rides which is suspiciously hard to achieve.   so now you have lost $590 in mileage and 272.36 for the rental. $862.36!!!! $&amp;@!%#  mind you that 150 miles in five days isn’t even roughs you could easily be doing much more meaning.. you likely are losing ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS using express drive!!   AND ALSO YOU ARE CAPTIVE TO LYFT.. meaning you can’t drive for UBER who in this market seems to be much more fair with sharing surges.. and can also come in handy to maybe get a faster ride out the airport  based on who pings first..   and don’t even get me started on the double and triple service feed for shared rides.. or the fact that you will never get your deposit back. shoot  my car literally smelled like an ashtray for a month when i got it from them.. i had to change out the cabin air filter myself and use multiple cans of ozone type freshener to eventually remove the smell from the seats and the ventilation.

First of all I think I should mention that he drives both for Uber and Lyft. He says that he was riding back to his home last night and arguing with his wife on the phone. As they were getting closer to his destination he says that he asked the driver 'which road he was taking' since there has been an on going road work on the route that the driver was following. He is a sweet guy and I have no doubt that his intentions where good but English is not his native language so he might not have come across polite  I don't know I wasn't there but he says that he was not yelling or raising his voice  he was just asking him a question.  He says that the driver told him ""whatever route the GPS is telling me"". I think that the driver was already irritated with him arguing on the phone in another language  which is what the driver told him later on  I will come back to this  and he might have felt being questioned and maybe even offended I am not sure. My buddy asks the driver to take the next street as the street that the GPS is asking them is closed. At that point the driver asks him to leave the car and says ""you were already arguing on the phone when you got into my car and just leave already"". My buddy doesn't want to leave  they are about 2-3 blocks away from his destination and he says just drive me to the address on the GPS. The driver pulls over and says ""GTFO my car"". At this point my buddy pulls out his phone and asks him to repeat what he said but the driver doesn't do that  it is not a video btw  he was voice recording. The driver gets out of his seat  physically removes my buddy from the car and rips his shirt off and scratches his arm while doing so. My buddy gets upset and they get into a fist fight. Once they were done he walks to his place and receives an email from Lyft saying that his account is closed while the incident is being investigated.  Now I am not a driver myself nor do I know much about the rules but what should be his next steps. Again  he is not from the US so he didn't think of calling the police when he got removed from the car but can the driver get physical with the passenger? Since account is closed he can't drive either  so there is that :)   Thanks for reading. He is just looking for a guidance.",0,8,I_poop_in_10_seconds,2019-07-31 19:55:52

But I'm not that happy where I work anymore  so I'm looking to Lyft to make some money while I look for something else. I'd like to start driving and have signed up already.

I am here to tell you that they are unprofitable by choice. They spend boatloads of cash on R&amp;D. Here is a quote from their recent 10Q SEC filing regarding R&amp;D expenditures:     ***Research and Development***   Research  and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related  compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs  related to our autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and  development costs are expensed as incurred.  We  plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and  development efforts to expand the capabilities and scope of our platform  and enhance the user experience. We expect that research and  development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.  &amp;#x200B;  Here is a link to their filings: [https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items\_per\_page=10&amp;order=field\_nir\_sec\_form&amp;sort=asc](https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&amp;order=field_nir_sec_form&amp;sort=asc)  &amp;#x200B;  Stop being fooled into believing that they can't pay drivers more. They can. They just won't. They'd rather put their drivers out of work permanently. So please stop using unprofitability as an argument for anything  all it shows is that you have no idea what is actually going on inside Lyft.",57,37,Anonthroway357159,2019-09-16 12:29:50

2.0,0.3824,"fight, drive, start, back, car, give, ride, guy, stop, end",Lyft,Lyft strikes again.,"So here I am I go out to get this streak bonus and I'm driving down a major highway in Pittsburgh and I accept a ride that I'm headed away from on acceptance  so I need to go the opposite direction on the highway when it realizes(not even 10seconds after I accept) and it corrects for me turning around it then jumps the time from 12 minutes to 25 minutes by the time I've turned around and headed back towards the person after the 1st exit possible that time is back down to 20.  Well about 5 minutes away from the rider it ""bails"" me out because I took too long. Because it is a bail out I now lose my $5 cancelation fee even though I've driven roughly 15 minutes to the person And it cancels my streak bonus($10). So continuing to drive I then am headed through the liberty tunnels and as soon as I entered the tunnels(if your not familiar with pittsburgh it is a 2mile long one way tunnel system that takes quite a few minutes to get through at rush hour) a request comes up I accept the request once again it says 13 min at the acceptance screen then not even 5 seconds later the first number to appear on navigation is 19  then 22  then 27 some how it thinks that I could have magically turned around in the tunnel and be headed in the opposite direction even though there is a whole other tunnel I have to go through. So I get out of the tunnel I turn around to start heading back once again drive about 15 minutes to the person and about 4 minutes away it cancels so again it doesn't give me a cancelation fee because  i was ""bailed out"".  So I've been driving around for almost 2 hours and I've made $4.92 I left my house with a quarter tank of gas and now I am completely empty roughly $15 worth of gas gone so I have spent $10 to  drive for Lyft today. Then I call to get the cancellation fees I deserve and earned according to the language of the cancel fee information. So here's the audio from the phone call(I have a business so all my calls are recorded)... Listen to LYFT driver support call on #SoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/rob-gratzmiller/lyft-driver-support-call .... they first answer at roughly 12min in(incredible!! It normally takes 45+) she try's to ""trouble shoot""  which means basically to blame everything except lyft weather thats the connection   my phone   my tablet(I run both and have done that for 2 years)  everything except their system and refused to give a pay out on either the bonus or cancel fees and claims it ""could"" be a connection issue(fyi they can see if the connection drops and for how long the system is built to actually allow small interuptions). I ask for a supervisor at like 15 minutes the first time   finally at the 23 mark she stops trying to blame everything else and starts the process of getting the supervisor 11 minutes later I finally have a supervisor on the line. At the 35 mark I mute the call to apologize to my rider getting in for the fact that I'm on the phone with Lyft. At 36 she says they cant pay anything (even though 5 days ago they did) at 37 the supervisor blames the connection again. Then just before 39 she admits the ""jamaican"" would have been flagged and got in trouble for doing the right thing and paying a fee that I met all the listed requirements to earn. So then the best part....the part for the 2 of you that read this far...at 42 they admit us drivers aren't even supposed to know that we are ""bailed out"" by the algorithm we are to believe the ride is cancelled and the only way they talk about it is if we already know and are instructed to not use the term with drivers to keep it as a backup excuse. Then goes on saying how she cant make any other comments and she is the ""highest level"" and that they have a script they must follow...but it's not really a script but is but isnt but is....lol just listen to that part...then also admits Lyft does not staff enough agents to man their phones  then tried to tell me it was illegal to record my call and immediately hangs up. So sadly you dont get to hear me go in on her laying out the exact law that because it stated at the start of the call ""this call my be recorded"" which once stated removes all expected privacy and gave the ability to legally record. So for the one guy who read to this point who is probably a driver and has most likely gone through an IDENTICAL scenario thanks for hearing me vent and yes they are fucking over all of us drivers  a billion dollar a year company cant pay out even $20 of fully EARNED money.  If anyone at Lyft sees this I just want to say THANK YOU  for finally making me leave you  once this month is over I will deactivate and NEVER drive for you again  from yours truly  a reliable  always friendly 5 star driver with 800 rides. You ran me away. Also that rider was dumbfounded because she listened to it all first hand and said she wont be riding Lyft anymore after hearing them treat me like that.",0,14,rgratz93,2019-09-24 23:44:08

3.0,0.2705,"strike, driver, make, day, work, today, protest, company, people, app",Lyft,My analysis of Lyft's actions during the pandemic  and a limited insight into PPZ,"As anyone familiar with recent postings can recall  Lyft has been egregiously screwing Riders and driver's alike during this crisis. Poor people in low-income areas especially are getting absolutely slaughtered with high prices  having to order Lux rides to avoid paying 4x or MORE for a regular ride.  I have made multiple post with screenshots over the course of multiple hours  (and I have many more) that clearly show Lyft charging absurd 400%+ Surge rates to Pax  while ZERO PPZs will be present ANYWHERE on the map.   At first  I thought my 8-month-ago analysis was correct and Complete - Lyft's algorithm was being used to herd drivers where they wanted them  and at least initially  ppz appearance and dollar value were tied more to this  than to handle and reimburse for supply and demand surges as they happened in real time.  I STILL think this is a large part of what the algo does - its all about manipulation of the map and assets - why else would you only show ONE box  with every driver getting their OWN  UNIQUE PPZ appearances?  Surge zones were designed to get drivers to move do the areas of highest demand; this radicalized version does that to the most precise degree possible  and on a very micro scale since it's applicable on a per-driver basis.   HOWEVER - something clicked a few days back while I was waiting for PPZs to pop up.  It seemed to me that the earlier I went out  the longer I would have to stay offline before a PPZ would appear - and it also seemed to me that it all just ""STARTED"" at once  vs naturally gearing up  again  BASED ON ACTUAL DEMAND.   On day 6 of tracking this entire issue  and 2 days into trying to figure out how to get the PVCs to appear earlier  I was getting frustrated after sitting offline for 1 hour and 45 minutes while watching 500% surge rates being charged in MOST of the city.  All of a sudden  in the hood  a $25 PPZ appeared!  And then it was off to the races.   Nothing of note happened the following shifts  and then today happened.  It had never dawned on me  I guess because initially it seems like a retarded hypothesis  to check and track the goddamn TIME.  Which I have now done.   Granted  my sample size is small - less than 2 full weeks of shifts  and I've only repeated what I'm about to say TWICE - but I HAVE repeated it and it is super precise for it to be a coincidence LOL.    In Atlanta  unless there is HUGE demand  or Lyft has some other method of modifying  PPZs will not appear until 7am.   At 7am  PPZs begin to appear around the $2.30 - $3.00 range  depending on where you are - if you are in the hood  those PPZs will skyrocket quickly - these Pax are getting raped the most  and I would assume Lyft once as many regular drivers in the area as possible  before the Pax gets smart and looks at the premium rides  thus the increased dollar amount.  Could this be changed day to day?  I'd put a kidney on it!  But right NOW  This is happening on a daily basis. While I was not paying attention to the time on the other days I have been tracking this unethical Behavior  I was able to figure this out SOLELY due to the fact that they appeared to all start around the same time on weekdays.  I do not recall this behavior prior to the pandemic  though I can't be sure tbh.     At this point  PPZ appearance APPEARS to follow SOME level of a demand-based pattern  which is consistent with all of my prior experience.  However I will bet a kidney that this is FAR from the only variable  though it SHOULD BE.    This is my main breakdown.  Nobody truly knows how the shit works  because that's how they want it. And while I'm sure there are MANY errors  I'm on the right track  I know it.  Some additional things to note:   1) prior to the pandemic  if things were STUPID busy and PPZ rates were upper $20 and higher  rides thrown into your queue would ALSO show a bonus  giving you a false sense of fairness i guess?  Those bonuses were ALWAYS lower than what I would get if I just logged off  however.    NOW  though  I have yet to see this happen. Rides thrown into my queue during rush hour NEVER have a bonus  and I do mean NEVER.  But if I LOG off after the ride  as SOON as it processes the trip and returns me to ""waiting for trip"" mode  BOOM  a PPZ appears!   SHADY?  Lol naaaahhhhhh   2) back when this ppz craft first started  occasionally during a busy time when for some reason a bonus was not added to a ride in my queue  an amount would be adjusted on the back end. This is actually PER LYFT'S WRITTEN (One of the few)  STATED POLICY.   It didn't happen often  but it did happen.  I hadn't seen it happen in many months however  and the pandemic has NOT changed that.  When you know that I have packs is being charged 500%  and you have $0 of bonus  you kind of think that written policy might come into effect.  Lol Naaaaahhhhhhhh.   So I've drawn a couple of hypothetical conclusions...... It appears that the Lyft algorithm or AI or whatever  is practically broken. I think they had it tuned to always give them the house advantage when it comes to surge payouts  and now the pandemic has exacerbated that little nugget of programming  and they don't know how to fix it.  On top of that  I think they are ALSO intentionally fixing the board in various areas so that they are RAKING IT - guys and gals don't forget these companies had never profited a dime leading up to this pandemic  so it is highly logical to assume that this could have put them both under. However  about five or six weeks ago  I seem to recall they both stopped making a lot of noise. Remember  they were barking REAL LOUD  as they do  around the time that CARES Act was passed  so they could pass the buck on taking care of their drivers to the government  which is basically just putting it right back on the drivers of course lol.    Q2 earnings should be interesting.  SPREAD THE WORD - UBER IS DOING IT TOO  they just aren't being NEARLY as evil with their drivers.  Probably because they aren't morons and can probably reprogram their algo when needed or something - Uber always has surge zones up  but every time my buddy has shown them to me  they have been 1 to $5  or other single digit amounts  with again the same 350% to 500% surge rates for regular passengers.    Tweet this  share it  email it  I don't care - I don't run alt SM accounts  so I'm not keen to put my name on this at the moment.  I may start an alt  but I honestly don't really care about recognition; I'm looking for fairness and justice - I can assure everyone that as a lux driver  I'm still doing just fine thank you - but anyone stuck as a regular driver is getting screwed SO hard.  I can afford to wait for a PPZ - but I am NOT the common case by any stretch.  And once things get moving  it's REAL HARD to keep track of things to know how badly ur getting hosed.    STAY VIGILANT AND GET THE WORD OUT!     TL:DR - Lyft do bad things - mad man with mean post attract many shills and make overlord many mean face!  (really?  I spent a lot of time on this - read it please!)",1,14,Nightrogue77,2020-07-14 03:32:56

Should we crowdsource evidence of this happening and work on building a Class Action Lawsuit?,"[sorry for posting this from a throwaway but because it might be a controversial opinion and possible beginnings of a class action lawsuit against p9r  a multi-million data corporation  I am taking anonymity precautions.]  So  my wife got into Turking recently. She does a fair bit of data entry at her job and while she was doing batch transcription requests she noticed she received rejections from some p9r HITs that she was 100% sure  were submitted without error.   I feel like was also burned in the beginning of my own Turking career by p9r  with what I felt were wrong/""false positive"" rejections. So I linked her the r/mturk threads which talk about various instances of p9r supposedly screwing over Turkers and why p9r request should be avoided if you care about your HIT approval rate. Instead  she decided to do a little experiment/investigation.  My lovely wife is a pretty vindictive and vengeful person when she feels like she is slighted. I guess you could say that she values honor/justice and she absolutely hates being conned and suckered. So she had the idea to Screen Capture herself filling out p9r requests and review the recorded footage of said rejections.   Out of 200 p9r transcription requests  15 of them were ""rejected"".   Upon the two of us reviewing of her screen capture footage of these rejections: all 15 of her rejected HITs were verified by us to be incorrect by p9r  with submissions containing ""illegible"" and ""blank"" as answers comprising the 11 of the 15 rejections.  The remaining 4 rejections were correctly filled out transcriptions of handwriting that was either somewhat messy or written in big letters and some portion of the word or name being missing from the sample picture.  From her test with a sample size of 1  it seems that p9r requests seem to have a 7.5%-out-100% ""incorrect rejection"" / ""false rejection"" rate on transcription requests.  Now I understand this is anecdotal evidence  so that's why I'm throwing this out there as an idea: let's crowdsource and organize data on p9r's HIT rejection rates as dedicated project.   Project participants Screenshot or ""Screen Capture"" Video Record p9r's Transcription HITs and we match up and review each of them.   We'll verify that the p9r HIT(s) were rejected incorrectly and contact p9r for each of them.   If there is no response to the reject appeals  we'll tally them up as evidence. Perhaps eventually use this data to organize a class action lawsuit against p9r for harming user's Mturk reputations/statistics and ultimately damaging Mturk as a platform with their own irresponsibility.  Maybe it'll make requesters think twice about harming users for their own mistakes or it could spur amazon into creating a better rejection appeal system for Mturk workers.   I'm throwing this out there as an idea on her behalf.  Any thoughts?",2,5,Throwaway910394,2019-02-21 03:50:24

I’m designing a research study on MTurk and would appreciate your advice.  1) I am looking for a certain subgroup of people to participate in the study. I have read that it is preferable to have a separate HIT to determine eligibility instead of using the ‘premium qualifications’ offered by MTurk. My question is: In the screening questionnaire  is it ok for me to ask people for their MTurk ID numbers? This way I can assign them the ‘custom qualification’ that they need to access the actual study and also so that I will be able to link their screening questionnaire info to the info collected in the study. Is there a better way to do this?  2) When we conduct research in person  we typically offer partial compensation to those who decide to withdraw from the study part way through. Is there a way to offer partial compensation on MTurk? My idea was to offer a small amount for the HIT and then in the consent form explain that everyone will receive this amount  but that participants who complete the full study will receive a bonus. So if my total compensation is $7  the ‘base rate’ will be $2 and then I would give a bonus of $5 to anyone who completes the whole thing. That way  people who withdraw still receive something and then those who actually complete the whole study can receive the full amount. Does this make sense?,4,7,Research_1029,2020-04-14 14:56:21

I received the same generic feedback response as many of you had.

I just need a bit of advise on an assessment that I had today.   Like the title mentions  I had a student (level 1) who did not show up today until the last 5 minutes. When I started class there were drawings on the intro slide  so I assumed she was there initially. Therefore  I contacted the fireman. When we got to the 20 minute mark  the parent got online with the child. Said child had fallen asleep and Mom was trying to wake her up. She was crying  would not stay upright  and would not participate at all (understandably). Couldn't even get a wave out of the tired little cutie.   The problem is that I am unsure how to assess the child since she did not participate. Do I just score the child zeros? It seems unfair and inaccurate. But I am unsure of another path. Any insight?

We went downstairs to find that a pipe had burst (stupid cold weather) and water was pouring into our lobby. The fire department showed up to try to turn off the water  but wouldn't let us in to the building until it was shut off.   I knew I wouldn't make my 1st class  so chatted on the mobile app to let them know. This was marked as a Teacher Cancellation. For the 2nd class  I thought I would be able to get in (how long does it take to shut off water???)  but as it got closer I chatted and told them what was happening and I might be a couple minutes late  then at 2 minutes after start time told them I wouldn't make it after all. We were then allowed in (and thank goodness no issues in our unit  as the pipe was below us)  and I made my next classes. I noticed that the 2nd class was marked as a TNS.  So far  there has been $10 deducted for the TNS  nothing deducted for the Cancellation.  I sent in change requests to mark the 1st miss as soft (with photos  but no other documentation)  and the 2nd miss to a Cancellation. Both were denied.  My question is  are there any implications of leaving them as is that I'm not thinking of? Aside from adding it as 1 cancellation on my contract (not particularly worried  this is rare for me)  and the likely $20 deduction (I'm assuming they'll ding me $10 for the Cancellation)  are there any issues to consider? Just trying to decide if it's worth trying to find documentation and submit again.  Thanks for your thoughts!,1,2,ActualRole,2020-01-19 12:33:39

I have over 500 5 Apple feedbacks  and a 5.0 rating.  I received a 1 Apple rating  no comments  just a ‘patience issue’ tag.   The student is a regular. 20 classes over the past few months. There have been weeks in a row when I am his only teacher  thought it seems he has other regular teachers. Never received a single feedback before.   The lesson was a UA class L2 Lesson 6 review/assessment class. I gave him a perfect score and gave him a glowing review. Haven’t re-watched the whole lesson in its entirety  but I couldn’t see anything obvious that deserved the tag. If anything  I might have looked bored or disinterested at times  but not impatient (he’s good at assessments but not very expressive).   Should I:   A) Request a review. A bit tough here to objectively prove the tag is wrong. Without specific details  there’s really no way to defend myself besides “I was patient throughout the class.” It will be totally up to the reviewers subjective opinion.   Or  B) Reply to the feedback. Something like  “Thanks for your feedback. However  without any details  I can’t improve my teaching.

The e-mail says they care about our feedback!!! (\*rolls eyes\*)  Here's what I wrote them:  ""I received the e-mail today concerning the new Service Fee Structure  and I just want to say I vehemently disagree with it. Under two separate contracts  I've been teaching for VIPKid since 2016 and have watched as the bonuses and incentives you once offered have all dried up in favor of ""token centers"" and ""six apple programs."" It's been annoying  but understandable as the company grows and continues to hire expediently without regard to the bookings of current teachers.  But now  this current system would result in me  if I continued teaching the same amount of classes I am at the moment  receiving about a 7% pay cut. The tier structure is disguised to make it appear that long-term teachers are making more money  but one quick look at the differences in payment dispel that illusion. Raises should be based on feedback and teacher dependability  as they have been in the past. Telling us a company-wide pay cut ""is the best way to recognize teachers for their work"" is a slap in the face  and to announce that pay cut during a worldwide economic disaster just adds to the insult.  VIPKid has many competitors who now offer a much better package for teachers than this company. If changes are not made regarding this Service Fee Structure  you will almost certainly lose some of your best  long-term teachers to those competitors. I currently have a 5.00 rating from parents and have for the most of the last three years  and I will definitely consider leaving if you don't make changes to this insulting new payment structure.""  We'll see if my 5.00 parent rating suddenly dips or my bookings take a nosedive. I don't care. I'm done :)   P.S. If anybody has a referral for a similar company that they enjoy and who doesn't treat their teachers like dirt  PM me!",1,20,epoetin_alfa,2020-05-29 22:56:54

Client got extremely pissed off and I apologized profusely  while explaining the situation.   Client said a bunch of nasty shit to me but I remained professional.

With many people posting here about their accounts being banned  it seems like that would be helpful.,Would a go-to list of bannable actions/behaviors (in layman's terms  not legalese) be helpful?   For example  I see freelancers say that you can be banned for communicating with a client outside of Upwork. But is that true? I've been browsing through Upwork's [User Agreement](https://www.upwork.com/legal#CONTRACTUALRELATIONSHIP)  looking for language that states freelancers cannot communicate with clients outside of the Site but haven't found it (yet).   Of payments outside of the Site  it says that users agree not to:   * *Submit proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contract  hire  work with  or pay outside the Site.* * *Accept proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contract  invoice  or receive payment outside the Site.* * *Invoice or report on the Site or in an Opt-Out Fee requests an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between Users.* * *Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments off the Site.*,1,7,BabyBoughtMeLobster,2020-01-16 00:28:35

4.0,0.5625,"time, week, hour, work, call, thing, minute, long, wait, put",Upwork,Anyone interested in joining a weekly accountability group?,I'm thinking about putting together a weekly group accountability video calls for people who work remotely.  The idea is one focused weekly call with 3 other professionals who work in a similar field and have similar goals. You each get 15 minutes to explain what you do  what your current goals are  and what your current obstacles are.  The idea is that it will help you set professional goals and then stay accountable to them through the coming weeks and months. It is also a chance to give and receive professional guidance  feedback and support.  Perhaps most importantly  being self-employed can be lonely and isolating sometimes. I think spending some time with a team of people that support you  even if you don't work with them  would really help. In the short terms because of the lockdown but also in the long run.  This next part is entirely optional  but I think it would help keep things focused. In addition to a weekly group video session  we can each stake some money towards our professional progress that month (say $20)  at the end of each call we rate each other's professional progress for that week.  At the end of the month  the person who made the most professional progress (as rated by your peers) wins the money. We would need 10-25 people to do this  so it would be about $500 prize. The prize isn’t really the point  accountability and a sense of community are  but the prize will help everyone stay focused.  I can figure out a form so that people are paired with people in the same field  similar goals and similar levels of experience. I can also spend some time figuring out an escrow system  a way to rate each other after calls and a leaderboard.  If I spend the time figuring it all out  would anyone be interested?  Please leave a comment below if you are interested so that I can gauge whether or not it is worth putting something like this together.  Any other feedback on the idea  or ways it could be improved  are most welcome.  Stay safe.,1,2,PurpleWho,2020-05-01 14:35:42

Long story short  I am currently a college student  and due to COVID I am stuck at home for the fall semester. I would like to make some money before I go back to school in the spring semester  however there are not many businesses hiring where I live (in the U.S. btw). I came across Upwork while looking at online  remote type of jobs. I have not signed up yet  and before I do so I have a few questions:  * I would like to look for freelance writing jobs if possible  however I don't understand how this would work as a beginner. I consider myself to be pretty good at writing  and have received compliments from professors (not trying to brag  not sure how to explain this without it sounding like that though). I have never done any professional writing or freelance work  only academic work  so why would someone hire me? What type of work would even be available to me given my lack of experience? Would it even be possible for me to make money  etc? * How does the payment work  is it easy to get scammed  etc? * Is it worth it to make a little bit of money over the next few months?  Again  I apologize for asking so many questions  thank you to anyone who helps me out!,1,1,shadowcopter,2020-07-29 00:36:37

After 4 weeks  the person I'm working for decides he wants to slash my pay per video by about **40%** lmao can you even believe my reaction to such bs?  We renegotiated to a reasonable price and I get back to work. After a day or so I'm done  so I send him all the work and request payment.  A day goes by and he says he can't use the google drive links I sent  so I create a new link and send.  A day goes by  nothing. Then a week. Then two weeks. Then three weeks.  At this point I'm absolutely fuming  the motherfucker didn't even change the pay yet  and he's completely ghosted me. Even the channel he was uploading to went dark.  ""Oh well"" I thought to myself  I'm sure I'll get another contract real quick!  50 connects later and I ain't got shit yo. I guess I'm pretty crap at making proposals or my profile isn't good. At this point I can't tell.  I understand the competitive environment of upwork  so I'll keep trying and won't let this discourage me from getting that bag!

People often ask me to join their server even before the bot is made and I refuse and explain why. This one buyer has bought from me before. Right now I'm making a more intuitive bot for him and he said we should make a private server to extensively test the bot. I said I wasn't sure since it could potentially get me in trouble. If I make a private server for the sole purpose of the gig after the product is made and delete the server afterwards could I potentially still be breaking TOS? I was gonna email Fiverr support but wanted a quicker answer.,1,0,shadeyg56,2020-08-10 21:10:34

Because it’s a new music program  even the high school students are beginners and many of them feel discouraged and unmotivated because they feel like they’re starting too late for it to be worth it. It’s probably also important to note that I’m white in a 95% black school district  but I have been building good relationships so far.,14,5,fiveminutedoctor,2019-09-30 23:55:35

5.0,0.3186,"action, email, send, issue, account, participate, receive, review, message, support",MusicEd,Looking for advice on creating a protest music module,"Hi folks   I'm a choral music nerd and love how vocal music interweaves with identity and culture  and I'm interested in putting together the module described above to teach my third years (14-15 yrs old). I've a fairly flexible curriculum to teach how and what I want  and am encouraged to try anything I like. I'm thinking everything from slave songs in the American South  to civil rights protest song  Vietnam era folk song  Apartheid era south African choral music  gumboot dancing  U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday  even up to Where is the Love by the Black Eyed Peas (but would welcome lots of specific examples of songs and other ""genres"" of protest music  so to speak). This would work well with what they're learning in history too for some cross curricular learning  and I can probably dig out enough concepts from the musical example to satisfy the curriculum being taught.  I'd like to pair this with some kind of project or presentation or...something that they research and work on themselves to supplement their learning.  I'm a bit clueless as to what form this could take apart from some kind of PowerPoint that they present themselves  and would appreciate your input here.  Has anyone done anything like this? I don't want to reinvent the wheel if possible  so if anyone has any insights from doing something similar I'd love to hear from you.  Cheers   WP.",1,6,wet-paint,2019-11-12 22:48:38
