1,Lyft,Stop defending Lyft on the basis of unprofitability.,"After reading here for a while I noticed that a common retort to why drivers can't get paid more is that ""Lyft is unprofitable"" or something of that nature. I am here to tell you that they are unprofitable by choice. They spend boatloads of cash on R&amp;D. Here is a quote from their recent 10Q SEC filing regarding R&amp;D expenditures:     ***Research and Development***   Research  and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related  compensation costs and facilities costs. Such expenses include costs  related to our autonomous vehicle technology initiatives. Research and  development costs are expensed as incurred.  We  plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and  development efforts to expand the capabilities and scope of our platform  and enhance the user experience. We expect that research and  development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.  &amp;#x200B;  Here is a link to their filings: [https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items\_per\_page=10&amp;order=field\_nir\_sec\_form&amp;sort=asc](https://investor.lyft.com/financial-information/sec-filings?items_per_page=10&amp;order=field_nir_sec_form&amp;sort=asc)  &amp;#x200B;  Stop being fooled into believing that they can't pay drivers more. They can. They just won't. They'd rather put their drivers out of work permanently. So please stop using unprofitability as an argument for anything  all it shows is that you have no idea what is actually going on inside Lyft."

1,postmates,DOORDASH CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT........STEALING TIPS..WHOS NEXT?????????,   ## DOORDASH CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT  **ATLANTA  GA:** (February 8  2019) ‚Äì Attorneys from Heninger Garrison Davis  LLC‚Äôs class action group filed a class action complaint today against DoorDash  Inc. (Defendant) for breach of contract and unlawfully taking tips that were intended for their delivery drivers. ¬†DoorDash is a national food delivery service  and the case arises from their improper conversion of tips directed and intended for drivers.  DoorDash is an on-demand food delivery service which delivers meals from national üì∑restaurant chains and local restaurants  as well as groceries from places like Wal-Mart. ¬†When a customer places an order with DoorDash  a customer has the ability to leave an additional gratuity  or tip  for the DoorDash delivery drivers (called ‚ÄúDashers‚Äù). The default ‚ÄúDasher Tip‚Äù is currently set to 10% of the order  but the customer may also leave a custom tip.  In terms of compensation to its drivers  DoorDash promises each driver a guaranteed base pay for each delivery job  plus 100% of the gratuity. ¬†However  DoorDash does not remit the full amount of gratuity that a consumer leaves for a Dasher.¬† Instead of paying this tip to the Dasher  DoorDash actually uses the gratuity to cover its costs for the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers. ¬†¬†For example  if DoorDash promised the Dasher $5 base pay for the delivery  and the customer tips the Dasher in an amount of $2  the Dasher still only gets $5.  On its website and other marketing materials  DoorDash deceptively advertises and represents that a gratuity can be added for a delivery and that the driver would receive ‚Äú100% of tips‚Äù from the customer. DoorDash does not disclose that it keeps a substantial portion of this additional charge for itself as its own additional revenue to offset the guaranteed base pay promised to Dashers. This deceptive compensation scheme is illegal and violates federal and state law.  HGD attorneys Jim McDonough and Lew Garrison bring the action on behalf of the Dasher plaintiffs against DoorDash  Inc. for breach of contract  negligent misrepresentation  fraudulent inducement  conversion  unjust enrichment  and violations of consumer protection laws.¬† The lawsuit seeks the return of tips rightfully earned by Dashers in order to remedy DoorDash‚Äôs improper withholding of those tips  which resulted in Dashers not receiving 100% of the tips that were intended for them.  Even if you feel you are not ready to file a suit  consult one of our qualified lawyers as soon as possible so that you will know your options. We do not charge any fees upfront. In fact  we will only charge attorney‚Äôs fees if we obtain a financial settlement for you.

2,uberdrivers,Guess he won the fight,"I picked up my pax  his gf  and best friend from a local bar. His BF and GF sit in the back and start getting a little frisky thinking nobody can see cause it's dark (and they are drunk). Needless to say  pax turned around and noticed.   The next 10 minutes of the ride were so awkward I offered to take her somewhere else after the drop-off if she didn't feel safe. She says no  it's fine.  As I am dropping them off pax says ""I'm about to whoop some ass and never see them again. Don't worry I will tip you"".   I pull down the street and turn around to leave the neighborhood and as I pass them pax is doing a flying punch at BF and makes good contact. I stopped and watched a little in my rearview as they threw down and contemplated calling the police  but thought hey they have to work it out and it's only hands.   I got a $5 tip from pax about 10 minutes later.   What a trip."
2,UberEATS,Rich DeMuro confirming what we already knew about DoorDash. I fuss a lot about Uber  but at least they don't do this. And I don't have to fight for a time slot...,nan
2,uberdrivers,Two strikes and I'm not picking you up!,"Another day I got a request from a passenger who had a 4.3 rating and sent me a text asking  ""are you coming?"" Once I saw that text I cancelled the ride. I've always told friends who are driving if the passenger is going to be a pain in the ass prior to pick up they're going to be a pain in the ass in the car."
2,uberdrivers,Keep a record of all the times you felt unsafe with a passenger but were afraid to cancel because of potential punitive actions by Uber. Uber will eventually face a class action lawsuit  be ready for it.,You think it's odd that Uber keeps sending safety notes to you?  Because they are worried and they should be worried.

2,uberdrivers,Had my biggest fight with a pax tonight.,"Second ride of the night  immediately get pinged after dropping off first pax. 4.96 rating and literally down the same street. Awesome. She's ready to get in my car before I even come to a full stop. So far  great.   She gets in  I confirm the name and address (grocery store). Not even a few minutes into the ride and ""Ugh  shit."" I respond ""Is everything okay?"" ""Yes  I just don't seem to have any small bills.""  I immediately understand what she's trying to say and I tell her that her showing up on time was my tip. She says it's unacceptable and that she'll figure something out and proceeds to try to tip in the app.  We start talking and have some really great conversation. Right before we get to grocery stores parking lot she gives me a twenty dollar bill(couldn't figure out the in app tipping). I didn't feel right about it seeing as I only drove her 2.1 miles. She insisted. I tell her if she refuses to take her money back that I'm going to sit in the parking lot and wait for her to come back. She hits me back with ""Then I'm just going to tip you another $20"" and shuts the door.  Not even a full 10 minutes and she's already back. I help her put her things in my trunk even after she insisted it wasn't necessary. We get back in the car and she asks me how to request uber so she gets me again. I laugh and tell her I'm taking her home for free. We continue talking and she casually slips me another $20. I insist she take it back  but she isn't having it. (Two jews arguing over NOT taking money  who would have thought?!)  She says she's blessed and that ""it feels right"" to give it to me.   ""You are something else [pax name].  Thank you""   We continue talking and she mentions how her husband had recently passed and how she's new to the city. We arrive at her apartment and I help her with her groceries. She insists that I don't have to walk all the way to her apartment but I wasn't having it.   She ends up walking me back to my car and thanks me again for my help. I tell her that she wont understand this when I tell her  but that she was a godsend for me.  She gives me a big hug and we exchange numbers.  Everything happens for a reason  sometimes you just don't know that reason. Except this time I feel like I know what it was. My neighbor's husband had passed away about 11 years ago. She is like a second mother to me and even before her husbands passing  we were very close. And after  I helped look after her three sons and did whatever I could to help out.  Pax has already texted me  thanking me again. feelsgoodman.png  tl;dr: My faith in humanity was restored "
3,InstacartShoppers,Upvote this if you are on strike today! I want to see #s!,Upvote this if you are participating in the strike today. I want us to see how many of us are doing this so when we start to question that $30 batch sitting in queue  should we take it or not  we see we're not alone in this.
3,uberdrivers,We should be fighting to be treated like contractors not employees.,So many of you guys are fighting for the wrong cause. We shouldn‚Äôt be fighting to be treated more like employees we should be fighting to be treated more like contractors.      Having a blanket TOS for all contracts is actually against most contract law. Each individual contract is supposed to be treated as a separate agreement thus we should be given much more information about the ride before we accept the contract otherwise what we are doing is not contract work  it more closely resembles that of a commission based employee.   All I want is to be treated like a contractor which is what all of us should actually be fighting for.
3,uberdrivers,"Why Wednesday's ""strike"" will be a big fat failure and a complete waste of time","Simply turning off the app will only increase surge rates and attract a bunch of new drivers which you'll have to compete with over the next few months in already oversaturated markets. Turning off the app will never work in your favor.  If you really wanted to disrupt Uber and Lyft  you would **accept rides then sit**  if several thousand people did this in a large metropolitan are such as Los Angeles  it would prevent new drivers and so-called ""scabs"" from getting rides and riders would have to wait extra long for rides.  Accept.  Sit.  Disrupt."
3,uberdrivers,When on strike  use Uber's network against them.,When on strike  remain online  text your passenger you are on strike and will not be taking them to their destination.  The passenger will likely bring this up to the next driver who picks them up out of frustration or interest. This will spread the word to drivers who are not aware in real-time through out the day. Use Uber's network against them.  Also  someone cross-post to lyft.

Pretty much all us turkers are very desperate for even a little bit of money that most of us are actually waiting around for panda crazy to grab penny HIT's. Its actually legit making me depressed. This post was just a little shower thought  I mean no hate on anyone at all. Just kinda crazy how someone can sit and play a video game making more in a single day then I do in a year at my IRL job. If I had better internet sure id try streaming  but alas my internet is garbage tier so no streaming whatsoever for me. Mturk is good for extra side income tho and that I am grateful for.

4,Nanny,My perfect nanny family strikes again,I‚Äôve been with my NF for almost 3 years. They never cease to amaze me. Gas money  amazing pay  amazing kids  never go against my decisions with discipline  I get paid when they go out of town/are home for the day  minimum 15 hours a week  etc.   This upcoming semester  I have to go all day on Fridays. I was so nervous about them not being willing to work with my new schedule and they AGREED. This will probably be my last semester  which sucks. But I‚Äôm so thankful.   The kids have become like siblings to me. They‚Äôre 9F  16F  and 18M. I‚Äôm primarily responsible for 9F now  but the middle child would need rides/we‚Äôd get our nails done together sometimes  oldest is there studying or in between work/gym and we‚Äôve taken 9F to movies/lunch. He even invited me to his graduation and middle child wants me to all her shows. It‚Äôs amazing.   It‚Äôs so nice to know I‚Äôll leave the nanny life on a high note after 8 years.

4,Nanny,‚ÄúFight like a mother‚Äù,This is a throwaway because at the end of the day I absolutely adore my nanny family and I just need to get this off my chest.  I have two nanny kids. 4M and 1F. 1F has a very rough first year. She spent months in the NICU and while she has a positive outlook going forward  she will never be 100%  and we are still not sure what exactly her life will look like - the quality and length of it should be good  but we are still learning about the extent of her needs.  MB has gone above and beyond finding her the best (and extra therapies)  advocating for her  fundraising  getting second opinions - you name it  she‚Äôs probably done it. For 1F.  4M on the other hand... it‚Äôs like 1F has been so sick that 4M must be healthy. He‚Äôs so ‚Äúbrave‚Äù (like his sister  of course) and ‚Äúunderstanding beyond his years‚Äù (about his sister  of course) and ‚Äúhas no adverse effects from their hospital stay‚Äù (besides crying every time there‚Äôs a transition and the stress induced stutter he‚Äôs developed).   She recently said to me ‚ÄúI feel like I missed out on all of 3‚Äù (the kids birthdays are super close together). And the fact is - she did. I attended all of the school parties. I took kiddo on his first roller coaster ride  his first zoo trip  last day of school and first day of summer camp  potty trained - you name it  I probably did it this year. And I know that in part I did all of that because MB and DB knew that 4M was in good hands with an adult who adores him.  But she recently posted online about all of the advocating she‚Äôs done for 1F and ended it by saying ‚Äúfight like a mother!‚Äù And just - I have been advocating like crazy for 4M. He needs to see a speech therapist and a play therapist and needs to spend more quality time with his parents that doesn‚Äôt revolve around 1F and her diagnosis. And it has been slow and required me to push to get all of this done. It has gotten done though and 4M will hopefully benefit greatly from the services he is receiving.   Fight like a mother  for both of your kids.  End rant.  And I do feel awful for MB and DB and the situation they‚Äôre in and I would never want to be in their position and all of that. And I know MB has some mental health issues stemming from the 4 months baby girl spent in the NICU and all of the trauma that entailed. And MB knows exactly how I feel about her needing to spend quality time with 4M and they are genuinely trying  especially now that there is a clear medical plan in place for 1F. I just. Ugh. 4M being healthy does not make his needs any less important than 1F.

4,doordash,Devils advocate,I have been dashing for a few months now and am new to this Reddit thread. I fail to understand why all the negativity and hostility toward doordash here.  I started dashing as a side gig to supplement my student loans in my free time. Doordash has allowed me to easily make another $200 a week with just a couple hours a day. I have tracked everyone of my dashes in a spreadsheet and average $15 an hour. Most of the time I just look for when my area is busy and dash for an hour or two. I love the flexibility  driving generally relaxes me and I only have to deal with people for a moment and 99% of those people are generally appreciate me.  I am content with the current pay system. I know upfront if the order is worth it to me. If I make anything more  well its a nice bonus.  The couple times I have had an order  i have found support to be very helpful and generally reply immediately.   I have had my share of slow restaurants but this is not DoorDash's fault. I either just wait patiently or decline the order. My main job has a fair amount of work I sometimes need to bring home so I usually just bring my tablet in and get it done while I wait.  My only complaint is of the stability of their servers. I get that things happen. Why not just relax for a few minutes  be patient and just dash when it comes back online?  This will probably be downvoted to oblivion with all the cynicism here but I am sure there are some who will agree Doordash isn't that bad.
4,doordash,Are Dashers on strike?,What's going on with Door Dash?? I've been using the company pretty much weekly for several months. Our orders are normally $80-$100. We haven't had any trouble until recently  almost every order for the past few weeks has been missing items(could be attributed to the restaurant)  but last night's experience has me never wanting to use Door Dash again.   We ordered $102 of food. At 8:55 I received a text that the driver was arriving. 4 minutes later I got another text saying the driver was having trouble locating me  and gave me a number to call the driver. I called 3 times and never got an answer. At 9:04 I received another text saying the driver left our order with a neighbor. We checked all the departments close to us and no one had received our food. I attempted to call customer service and the recording said to expect a 20-30 minute hold time  so I used the app to chat with customer service. When I signed in  I was #220 in line. When I finally spoke to someone  they attempted to call the driver and also got no answer. To further insult me  the rep tried to offer my $102 as a credit for food we didn't receive! I was told I would be getting my refund in 5-7 business days. I posted my experience on their Facebook page  and noticed there are quite a few complaints similar to mine  and Door Dash hasn't responded to any of them in the past 24 hours. With a 30 minute phone hold time  and 220 people in line to chat with customer service  and so many complaints on Facebook  it's almost like the company is giving up.   This is upsetting  because it's been such a good experience until recently.

4,AmazonFlexDrivers,I gave up and joined a DSP,It‚Äôs been really difficult to get the blocks I need from the warehouse that I want so I just gave up and joined a DSP from the warehouse that‚Äôs literally just 5 minutes away from my house.   I just think it‚Äôs a better decision because I was Flex-ing full time. I was trying to get 2 blocks a day  5 days a week and I was having to drive 40 minutes to the next closest warehouse. With the DSP  I won‚Äôt have to be competing to get blocks and pressing the refresh button a million times a day to get one block. With a DSP  I‚Äôll be able to go to the warehouse that‚Äôs 5 minutes away from me everyday  I won‚Äôt have to take a 2 hour break in between blocks  I won‚Äôt have to wear out my car or pay for gas  and they actually pay more.   If you‚Äôre just doing Flex for some extra cash once in a while  then that‚Äôs perfect. But if you‚Äôre doing it full time  then definitely consider joining a DSP for all those benefits I said before.

Don‚Äôt be such shitheads.,Checked into an airbnb and was searching high and low for the welcome info page with WiFi info. Found a folder that had about 20 pages of paper but all were fliers about the protests happening in HK. i turn on my cell phone roaming to ask the host who said the paper should be in the folder. It becomes clear her prior guests deliberately threw out the WiFi ams welcome package to replace with fliers knowing future guests will be flipping through that to look for the WiFi info.   Wtf? What kind of inconsiderate assholes do this? No issue with your politics but don‚Äôt go actively throwing away important info.

The irony is these parents want an Ivey league professional  athlete and nurse for their child but can‚Äôt even meet professional standards.  Plans and thoughts on this ?

TL:DR Guest booked without realizing it was a private room and not a whole house. I told her before she arrived what she was booking and the guest decided to stay. Guest arrived early (noon)  stayed the night  left at 9;00 AM. Two weeks later she is asking for a refund because she didn‚Äôt stay. AirBNB called  I showed them the messages which clearly indicate she stayed the night (she messaged about how to get in when they arrived and messaged the next morning to tell me that she was leaving and left the key). AirBNB said they would close the case with no refund.   Until this evening  I am a little perplexes as to why my payout came up short and bomb into one of tonight‚Äôs payout details to find the lady was issued a complete refund because she provided ‚Äúproof‚Äù she didn‚Äôt stay here  except  she did.    Resolution specialist is reviewing the issue with his Supervisor and said they may need to contact the guest again and will call me back tomorrow but could offer no explanation for why they tried to pass the refund without updating me at all on the situation.    I am livid  too pissed to sleep and seriously considering whether or not any other booking agents could be as profitable as the AirBNB platform in my area.
